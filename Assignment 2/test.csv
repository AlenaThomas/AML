 henwood  psim  stinson  vince   the henwood runs for dabhol are  at least temporarily  over  however  the  main modeller for henwood  david yumigada  works out of their california  office   it maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs  and  explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group   in aparticular  now that i am going through some of the comments people have  raised on the psim model  i think there is value in understanding the way  henwood deals with hot and cold starts  ramp up costs  and with issues of  cycling plants   i think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the  psim  and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models   this is a suggestion  and so please let me know if you see value in this   regards   sandeep ,0
 lng by rail  vince   i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about  in the dabhol lng context  it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges  and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways   some time back  i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train  apparently  technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies  i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers   it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr  45  minutes from the dabhol plant  trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india  if we target end  consumers directly  we could easily sell at retail  type prices  and build in a large margin  even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller   the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced  and mostly trucked along  roads  increasing costs   the end aim is to keep income targets in india  so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock   hence keeping activity up in india  and showing that solutions exist  will  keep stock price buoyed  we could explore this idea if it appeals   regards   sandeep ,0

 market maker simulation v  2  stinson and vince   i finished the second version of the model which deals with open to close  trading   the major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at open  price which  will affect the p  l   i also added the output features that john wants to see   the cumulative p  l is path dependent  the net open allowed seemingly has  a strong influence on the cumulative p  l trajectory   the anomaly i  discussed  with vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination    could you review what i have done before we talk to john again   zimin,0

 p  option valuation model  mark   after recently reviewing the booking of the p  options  it is my  understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread  option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are  assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes  i  e  the price  process assumptions are consistent with standard black  76 model assumptions  extended to two commodities    the payoff for a call option is   payoff  max  0  a   b   k    where   a  nxwti  delivery price for nymex   b  posting price   wti swap     posting basis   k  posting bonus  fixed    the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options  is that leg  b  of the spread is a combination of three prices  the two  futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month  and the  average posting basis during the delivery month  combination of these  prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg  b  and  the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of  prices and its correlation with the nxwti price  i believe that this  approach is more straightforward than the alternative  which would be to use  a three or four  commodity model with its associated volatility and  correlation matrices   in summary  i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of  these types of options  assuming that the inputs are set correctly   regards   stinson gibner  v  p  research,0

 california update 3  15  01  executive summary   davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt   davis and pg  e negotiations at a standstill  sticking point is net short  for pg  e this summer   as the days go on with no word of a secured deal  involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs   ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources  dwr  rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills  until now  davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide  but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups  sources indicate that one of california  s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption   but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt  dwr   which is currently buying power on behalf of the state  needs more income to  securitize the planned  10 b bond issue that is key part of davis  plan to  sign long term power contracts  as dwr continues to spend  40 to  60 m every  day on power purchases  a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt  it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies  purchasing new equipment  etc  the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can  parks  other  programs  to purchase power  but dwr  s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued  the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover  10  billion worth of state bonds   davis  pg  e at odds  sources report that davis and pg  e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges  1  pg  e wants 2  9 times book  which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines  sce accepted 2  3    and 2  pg  e needs relief from davis for pg  es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state  and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases  especially for summer   the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red   3 to  4 b  and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power   with all this activity  davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature  sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro  tem john burton  burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation  and the state auditor is also planning an investigation   davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later   qf  s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities  sb 47 x may have been california  s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg  e  socal ed  and sdg  e  the bill designed to cut the qf  s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state  s  senate  sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates   out with hebert  in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert  jr  with texas puc head pat  wood  there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott  who favors hebert  and president bush  who wants wood   the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004  in effort to tone down the recent press reports  hebert has made  several token concessions to california  including  69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation   it  s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions  some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year  the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions  the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally  owned assets such as  bpa ,0

directors may have gone back to ad  libbing  enron or  enr  off   but for the big kahuna at the american utility  dabhol is still a  worthwhile project  while the entire enron board had almost decided to call  it quits and proceed with the termination of the  2  9  billion power project  at dabhol  the veto exercised by the company chairman kenneth lay has saved  the project    at least for the timebeing  sources said the meeting held on  tuesday at the energy major  s headquarters in houston could have sounded the  death knell for the only big foreign investment in the indian power sector   although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lenders  unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not  honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled  the veto exercised at  this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost  to the indian venture  company sources said   we do not know what went on  there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out   with the  engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment  suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode  dpc was finding it even more  difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules   sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board would  be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its  shareholders if the project actually flopped  enron had similar bitter  experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then  justify such investments to the shareholders   enron  which had planned a major investments in india  s infrastructure  sectors such as oil and gas  lng  gas transportation  telecom and broadband  network  has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these  operations  the company  s mous with various other majors like indian oil  corporation  too  is in a limbo and the us major  s stake in the oil and gas  venture is up for grabs  however  even though lay is still hoping to find a  solution to the controversy back home  both dpc and mseb are still to get  down to negotiations

appreciate his crucial presence in  the first session of discussions with enron officials  lenders and gas  suppliers  sources in the mantralaya added that the government had also been  unhappy over

of india  ptc  come  together and sell dpc  s surlpus power  we have already mooted this  suggestion  but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power  ministry   the official said  the official said that the centre  which was  also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to  enron india  should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess  power to other states  the state government  s reaction comes in wake of union  power minister suresh prabhu  s discussion with chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh in delhi few days ago  it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh   there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term  ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states    deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess  power over and above the 300  400 mw needed for the state from the dpc  s 740  mw phase  i and soon to be commissioned phase  ii of 1  444 mw  to other needy  states  considering the high cost of power generated from dpc  which during  the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost  of rs 2  30  2  80 a unit from central and state utilities  there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol  the power minister reportedly said    deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down   he said  adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers                                      business standard  monday  7 may 2001  reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de  s ravindran  renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice  the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447  mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board  mseb  does not lift power  the project   s power purchase  agreement  ppa  has a clause to this effect  the state government   s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company   s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties   dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company   s  application had been pending with the chief minister   s office for months   only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state  the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb   s inability to buy power from  it  thanks to the board   s weak financial position  not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra  but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state  the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so  nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold  so  in effect  this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb  the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue  from such consumers   apart from captive power plants  independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards  they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status  with  its 447  mw capacity  the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1  000  mw  speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week  reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard  a provision  in third parties  ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb   s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project   the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state  a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions  a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official  subsequently  it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power  so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties  he said  the patalganga project along with the ispat group   s 1  082  mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report                                      the economic times  may 7  2001  no need of patalganga  bhadravati power  mseb  the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much  delayed reliance  industries  promoted patalganga and ispat industries  bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that  there is no need of these projects nor their power   the  loss  making board has communicated to the government that mseb had  no  interest  in patalganga and bhadravati  as it did not have escrow  able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra  state government sources said here on sunday    in last november itself  mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds   including they being unviable and  unaffordable   sources said   reliance  s project is no different from that of  dpc  s  patalganga is also naphtha  based and its ppa is on similar lines     after the enron experience  mseb cannot even dream of another gas  based  power plant in the state   a senior mseb official said  he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447  mw  patalganga and the 1  084  mw coal  based bhadravati   as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances   when contacted  mseb chairman  vinay bansal said   reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee  s recommendations   but expressed inability to give  further details   currently  bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report  which was set up to review the dpc  mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra   can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover   the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives  to which the reply had been negative  sources added   sources said  as of now  both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a  guaranteed payment  mechanism from  mseb  which  incidentally it has promised to dpc   all the three were cleared  as  fast  track  projects  but other than enron  reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire  especially bhadravati  which has been hanging afire  since last nine years   they added   moreover  the mseb official opined that given the current situation  if dpc  calls it quits from india  bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance  s  patalganga  patalganga  s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc  s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4  50 per unit to as high as rs  7  while bhadravati  s cost could be around rs 3  80 to rs 4 per unit  he  informed  mseb  s installed capacity ended on march 31  2001  wasl 4  000 mw and  it has generated 45  000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent   pti                                      business standard  may 7  2001  global bankers ask govt to honour dpc obligations  tamal bandyopadhyay  surajeet dasgupta  santosh tiwary in mumbai  newdelhi  global arrangers for the dabhol power company have mounted fresh pressure on  the finance ministry to honour the union government   s counter  guarantee and  have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the  power purchase agreement  ppa  between the dpc and the maharashtra state  electricity board  mseb   in a related development  the dpc has sent a note  to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the turn  of events as they have prevented the dpc from serving the ppa termination  notice last month   the lenders  in their turn  sent a statement   prepared by the new  york  based legal firm white  case   defending their stance saying they are  working in the best interest of the project  the lenders are expected to  meet in london over the next fortnight to take stock of the situation  the  deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as 10 days of the  three  week reprieve have passed  at the dpc board meeting in london on may  25  the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination  notice and got three weeks   time for themselves to convince the centre as  well as the maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the  controversial project  in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar dated  april 30  the global arrangers said the government must own up its  responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay  among the  stiff conditions  set by the arrangers  are the demand that the central  government ensure payment of all the pending bills of mseb for december  2000  january 2001  february 2001 and march 2001 which remain unpaid  without any protest or reservation by may 7  monday    any payment previously made under   protest  8 should be made free and clear of  such protest or any other reservation  and the center should ensure timely  payment of future bills by mseb  they said  meanwhile  sources said that the  finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the  dabhol projects in london stand on the issue  the lenders   list of demands  also include asking mseb to take steps required under the existing  contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of  financial close of phase ii of the project by may 7   they have demanded that the union government and the maharashtra government  should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will  take any step to impede the operation of phase i or the construction and  operation of phase ii without due cause  the lenders have also asked them to  ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and  equipment required for the project by may 21  csfb  anz export finance   citi  bank of america and abn amro are the global arrangers for both phase i  as well as phase ii of the project   the state bank of india  which is also a global arranger for phase ii  did  not sign the letter   ten days have passed since the lenders bought three  weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of  the ppa  since then  nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb  s  payment of the january bill to the tune of rs 134 crore under protest   said  a source among the global arrangers  come forward to meet its obligations  the lenders are planning to meet around mid  may in london and this time  they will be left with no choice but to give the go  ahead to the company to  terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the  issue  the source added  the lenders are  however  not ready to take the  blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company  the  white  case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the  project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the  last option   termination of ppa                                      business standard  saturday  5 may  2001  ge may pull out as dpc supplier  s ravindran in mumbai  after us  based bechtel  it is now the turn of general electric to review its  participation as equipment supplier to the controversial 2  184  mw power  project in maharashtra  being set up by the dabhol power company  bechtel is  the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment   primarily turbines  general electric  like bechtel  also holds 10 per cent in  dabhol power company  dpc   and both bechtel and general electric are worried  about future payments from dpc  sources familiar with the project said that  so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric  what is  worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june 7  when about  700 mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs   dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  have been locked in a  payments dispute for months  if mseb continues with its stance  dpc in turn  may not be able to pay general electric  in such a situation  ge may walk out  of the project  a final decision will be taken only in june  said sources   general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business  standard  senior executives at its public relations agency burson  marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to  speak on the issue  the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue   the first phase of the 740 mw has already been commissioned  after the second  phase of 1  444 mwis commissioned by december  2001  mseb will have to pay  dpc a minimum of rs 500 crore per month  the escrow account for this was to  have been made operational by april 7  2001  mseb has refused to do this   earlier  dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract  with the board  mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has  absolved dpc of all its liabilities   consequently  it will not operationalise the escrow account  this casts a  further shadow over dpc   s ability to pay general electric and bechtel  this  is worrying the lenders to the project as well  the situation has taken a  turn for the worse with dpc practically refusing to re

with caida  vince and stinson may want to  wait until kc claffy or i can visit portland  or have several enron  reps visit san diego for demos and related discussions   we have been talking to stan hanks for some time about enron  s  interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing  some of the performance features in coralreef that he has described as  relevant to enron  examples of existing coralreef analyses on oc 3  12  links can be found at    real  time   https    anala  caida  org  aix    post  processed traces   we are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability  analysis and for use by providers  an example of some existing  analyses can be found at  for end  to  end measurements  including those relating to service level  guarantees  we are working to make skping and sktrace more useful to  providers and their noc personnel  see  another tool of relevance to providers is our cflowd which analyzes  flow export data from cisco routers  see  http    www  caida  org  tools  cflowd    we would appreciate the opportunity to talk with enron personnel about  how to make these tools more relevant and useful to your needs   however

draft  of its charter is appended below  it focuses on producing educational  material about network measurement  and on developing new metrics  these  were the two areas of greatest interest amongst

charters  a  what types of network  and transport  layer metrics are being  used by isps in engineering and operating their networks   by customers for verifying service guarantees   b  what new services are being  or are likely to be  offered  e  g   diffserv  is there a need for higher  layer metrics to better  monitor and manage these services   c  will these new differentiated transport  and  application  layer services need new metrics   d  how can the service metrics be measured in a multi  isp  environment   e  how can customers verify these measurements   f  what requirements would service measurement introduce for  equipment vendors   g  how relevant are specific techniques  e  g  which flow  and  points of measurement to specific users  isp  customer  etc    requirements   h  how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived  by users  how do they correlate with performance   appendix b  background on the ietf working groups   rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement  rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two  way traffic flows   specified in terms of their end  point attributes  its primary goal was  to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the  following needs   a  wider range of measurable quantities  e  g  those  relating to ipv 6  and to class of service  b  simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c  better ways to control access to measured flow data  d  strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e  efficient hardware implementation   ippm wg  ip performance measurement  the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can  be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet  data delivery services  these metrics will be designed such that they  can be performed by network operators  end users  or independent  testing groups  it is important that the metrics not represent a value  judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad    but rather provide unbiased  quantitative measures of performance   rfcs  framework for ip performance metrics  rfc 2330   metrics   connectivity  rfc 2678    one  way delay  rfc 2679   one  way packet loss  rfc 2680

measurement   this is clearly a hard problem  e  g  does this just  mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive means  how  should the measurements be presented  etc     in short   rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes   ippm has concentrated on transport  layer behaviour of the  current  best  effort internet    rmonmib is beginning to consider

 option hedging for ees  eugene   bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday   for an option writer  he has the obligation to deliver  so he hedges it with  the underlying by adjesting delta positions  the hedging cost  theoretically   should be equal to the fair value of the option premium   on the other hand  for the option holder  he has no obligation  by delta  heging   he would pay double for the option  with no upside  so he should not hedge  it at all   if the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option  he should  sell  the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta  neutral  portfolio   this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option  underlyings   our question to you  if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the  ees  contracts  say fixed price sale contracts  what makes it possible to just  separate those options  and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options  we  conjecture that these  options are meant to hedge the original contract  by selling those options  you eliminate the upside of the  original contract   give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further   zimin,0

 re  lng may 19 decision  vince  thanks for the update  what i am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be  made on may 19  it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals  have already  been approved and executed  but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or  two   john  vince j kaminski  15  05  2000 17  14  to  john sherriff  lon  ect  ect  cc  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  david gorte  hou  ect  ect  rick  buy  hou  ect  ect  ted murphy  hou  ect  ect  subject  re  lng may 19 decision  john   this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions   1  i was not involved in the lng ship project  i shall read the dash  and give you my comments  without looking at the details  i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project  please  see point 2    2  elba island  i am working with doug rotenberbg  brad hitch  scott earnest   sally beck  s organization  and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction  the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron  s lng  related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges  a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow  tuesday  at 8  30   a few comments on the book design and my view of the project   a  the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis  marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long  term  contracts or became available due to some short  term frictions   the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long  term  contract prices  the economics of the deal  as represented by the book we are  setting up  will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis  arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us  in other words   we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction   b  the transaction will cover the period of 17 years  with an extension  option of  5 years   even if we can lock  in the lng volumes over this time period  we  have no ability to lock  in the other side of the spread  us gas prices  for  such a long tenor  this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng  nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking  in only one leg of the spread   one solution would be to cover  let  s say  50  of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock  in the nat gas side on the us market side   c  the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng  shipping rates  schedules  etc  i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market   d  my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal   that are good for enron  and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions   long  term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent   vince  john sherriff  05  14  2000 01  40 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc  lauren urquhart  lon  ect  ect  subject  lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven  t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well   anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have  i hope only temporarily  staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng   i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values  i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19  not very far  away   anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet  can you  please let me know where you stand now   i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well   look forward to connecting with you vince   john,0

 fw  london work  hi   how are you  london seems to be the same as when i left in august  no sun  cold  serious looking people  expensive  etc  in addition  we have had may day riots  a post office bombing  train strike  etc  not to mention all the excitement in enron credit   it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to  i am getting loads of conflicting messages  as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant  according to you and slava  the strategy paper  duffie report seems to be a higher priority  however  vasant seems to indicate  in his forwarded email  that this is not the priority at the moment   in addition  there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit  not only in the houston office  but even more so in the london office  this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit   a fish rots from the head    finally  i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report  do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear  that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting  infrastructure   or do you want to hear what i really see  hear  read  etc   if the latter is true  then i may need to write two reports  because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy   well  i think i have said enough for now  look forward to your feedback   thanks   iris       original message       from  shanbhogue  vasant  sent  friday  may 04  2001 3  39 pm  to  mack  iris  cc  dhar  amitava  subject  london work  hi iris   amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here  as a result  we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied  you should also make sure to understand the econometric  data analysis software side of the project   this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now  you should definitely sit with ben  george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used  but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data  both amitava and i will help as best as we can  and answer any direct questions  but we will have limited time to review documents  etc  i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming  but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data   hope the trip is going well  would you be extending the trip for some more time   vasant,0

 working paper list  etc  dear vince   i have put together a list of finance working papers  some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday  which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also  at least initially  as a learning tool  several of them  however  do contain innovations   i have asked ms  de claris to forward a copy to you   as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn   i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us  i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market  this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street   the question in my mind  hopefully not prematurely  is  if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business   i look forward to hearing from you soon   best regards  joao,0

 var  david   during today  s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations   mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system   we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory  also  in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor  and it  s difficult to model the price curves independently  we solve the problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves   we have agreed on the following   1  winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic  core  curves  he will investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run   2  the curves associated with the biggest 10  20 positions in each commodity should be  modeled as core curves  i  e  no mapping into other locations   it makes sense to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates   3  the results of an automated clustering  mapping  procedures should be systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions   this responsibility should be vested with one person  right now the responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible   research can allocate one person to this task   cooperation of trading and rac will be critical   vince,0

 re  marketpoint license agreement  dale   thanks for your message  in our phone conversation before the meeting you  mentioned  another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company  employees on a case  study   the cost of a weekly project would be  12  000 that would be applied to the  purchase price should  we go ahead and decide to acquire the software  this project would allow us  to evaluate the model and  come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model  internally   please  let me know more about this option   we are primarily interested in a long  term natural gas model and the database  for north america   unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite  we don  t  have resources to spend too much time on it   of course  a trading desk may be interested in the short term  version of the model  i shall talk to them about it   vince   dale m  nesbitt  on 11  13  2000 06  00  05 pm  to    vince  j  kaminski   cc   subject  marketpoint license agreement  john  vince   i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross  section of your people  thank you very much for setting it up  and thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people   as i mentioned to john  i am sending you the license paperwork for  marketpoint  i have attached our standard license agreement for your  consideration  as i mentioned  the license agreement covers the entire  bundled product  which includes   north american gas  short and long term   north american electricity  short and long term   world gas   western european gas   world oil  we are just finishing porting the world oil  world gas  and western european  gas models over from our old  now obsolete  software system into  marketpoint  so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of  months  however  the gas and electricity models for north america are  presently complete and tested  that should allow us to give you an  attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout  your worldwide business   as i understood it  you will want the gas modeling capability first and will  want to defer decisions on electric or other capability  as i mentioned at  the meeting  we are prepared to offer that for approximately  the fully  bundled price  as you read the license agreement  you will see that the  software licenses for  100  000 annually  the gas data for  5  000  and the  electric data for  10  000  marketpoint will agree to license you the gas  model plus the data for  the software license plus the data license for a  total of  55  000 annually  this is just under  the fully bundled price  i  think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting  and from  marketpoint   s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward  together with enron  if or when enron ever desires to   scale up  8 to another  model or model  s  from the marketpoint portfolio  we will simply scale you  up to the entire license agreement  this will allow you to decouple the gas  decision from any other decisions you might make   i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward    i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy  scope  and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs  i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness  i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use  i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues  i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together  we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business   if you decide to license marketpoint  we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model  which is the model we suggest you  begin with  and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar   our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar   thereafter  we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed  very fluent  and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later   thanks again  and all the best  if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send  please remind me  my notes don  t show  anything  but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted   dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc   27121 adonna ct   los altos hills  ca 94022   650  218  3069  dale  nesbitt  marketpointinc  com   license  doc,0

 latest draft  don   attached is my latest effort  it entailed fairly drastic  restructuring  and reorganization  of the earlier draft  my revision effort has been  directed at improving the focus of the paper  the new story is the following   1  enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid  eighties   2  economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic  reorganization of the company almost immediately  the result was the  creation of a new  unregulated energy trading operation  the strategy of  the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the  deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time  mid  eighties until  now    3  the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of  a  gas bank   the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult  problem to enron  s management in that there was no source of liquidity to  the market from a central bank authority  as a consequence enron had to  develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures   4  another consequence of the new business model was that it required a  different set of employee skills and talents  specifically  it required  were bright  energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying  entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses  furthermore  a  new  flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision  making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market  conditions  to monitor and manage this new  empowered  labor force  required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures   5  three primary tools of personnel management were adopted   i  measure  performance semi  annually   ii  tie compensation closely to performance   and  iii  allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best  opportunities   6  other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset  optionality  recognition of the value of networks in adding value to  trading platforms  and the use of mark  to  market accounting for business  transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions   if my  story line  sounds better than the draft i have attached its because  its the last thing i  ve written  at any rate i look forward to hearing  your comments and to getting this wrapped up   thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february   john   enron  paper  1  26  01  doc  john d  martin  carr p  collins chair in finance  finance department  baylor university  po box 98004  waco  tx 76798  254  710  4473  office   254  710  1092  fax   j  martin  baylor  edu  web  http    hsb  baylor  edu  html  martinj  home  html,0

 re  got ink  21846  what have you been up to   i don  t know about you  but i am sick and tired of going  down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges  cost more than the printer itself  i know how you feel   i print over 500 pages a day  and it feels like there is  a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet  now  this has got  to stop because i know it doesn  t cost the printer companies  anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work   well  it finally has  the superink solution   you  re probably thinking to yourself   gosh darn  not another  cheap knockoff printer cartridge   like you  i was very  skeptical at first  but my best friend  business associate  said it helped her save over  100 a month on printer supplies   so i tried it  i mean  there was nothing to lose because they  offer a 100  satisfaction guarantee  up to a one  year warranty  on all of their products and free shipping on all orders   let me tell you  it was one of the best decisions i  ve ever made   period  six months later  as i  m writing this message to you   i  ve gone from spending  1000 dollars a month on printer supplies  to now only  475  and i haven  t had to sacrifice the quality or  service that i received from the local office supply store  in fact   the service is even better  i  ve had 1 defective cartridge since  i started dealing with superink and they sent me a new replacement  within 3 days  no questions asked  now  i can print all i want   i was so happy with the results that i contacted their manufacturer  and got permission to be a reseller  at a big discount  i want  to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies  like i did  because a penny saved is a penny earned   i give you my personal pledge the superink soltuion will absolutely  work for you  if it doesn  t  you can return your order anytime  for a full refund   if you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the  printer companies  or tired of poor quality ink  toner cartridges   then i recommend  the superink solution   you  re probably asking yourself   ok  so how do we save all this money  without losing quality and service    modern technology has provided superink with unique  revolutionary  methods of wax molding that allow the ink  toner to  settle   which  prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and  handling  nothing  magic  about it  just quality  savings  big savings   here is the bottom line     i can help you save 30   70  per week  per month  per year or per lifetime  by purchasing any of our ink  toner supplies  just try it once  you  ll  keep coming back  there  s nothing to lose  and much money to be saved   100  satisfaction guaranteed  you will be able to print as much as you  want without wasting money or sacrificing quality  guaranteed   that is my pledge to you   to order from the superink solution on our secure server  just click  on the link below  or enter it into your browser    http    www  superink  net   if you have difficulty accessing the website above  please  try contacting us toll  free at 1  800  758  8084  thanks   sincerely  bruce tipton  if you do not wish to receive any more emails from me  please  send an email to  print 2  btamail  net  cn  requesting to be removed   thank you and sorry for any inconvenience  ,1
 re  cplex floating license  samer  s suggestion makes a lot of sense  we can start with something like one  floating dev  license  2 opl licenses and buy more later based on actual  usage  on the pricing agreement  it probably makes sense to get a guarantee  on the discounts for additional licenses for one year  or till dec    i am  definitely interested and can provide the share of funding necessary from my  clients   thanks   krishna   from  samer takriti  enron communications on 05  19  2000 11  14 am  to  ravi thuraisingham  enron communications  enron communications  cc  chonawee supatgiat  corp  enron  enron  pinnamaneni  krishnarao  hou  ect  ect  enron  samer  takriti  enron  net  stinson  gibner  hou  ect  ect  enron  tom halliburton  corp  enron  enron  vince j  kaminski  hou  ect  ect  subject  re  cplex floating license  chonawee and i just had a phone conversation with cplex  there are other  alternatives  products  that may help in saving time and cost  chonawee and i  feel that one floating develoment license  and one or two opl  a package on  sale that provides modeling and optimization features  licenses will do  in  addition  we need floating deployment licenses  for the development licenses   the charges should be split  equally  between the different groups that may  ask for optimization help  although it is hard to predict who may ask for  future help   we are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to  develop the needed solution but are not  in general  used to run the  software  the deployment licenses can be charged on per  use basis for  different groups   cplex is going to send us a new quote  we  ll make the decision soon after  that    samer,0

 re  steve leppard  dale   my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london   we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate  this process   of course  anjam will be very unhappy about it  but we cannot manage around  him  any longer   i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase   i would like to offer him a significant increase that  goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility   a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market   we see the market for technical people going through the roof in  practically every location  where we operate   a contract is not a good solution in my view  it creates a sense of false  security for  both an employee and the company   i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation  i shall cc  you   i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well   vince  dale surbey  07  11  2000 10  23 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject  steve leppard  hi vince   hr is working on a mid  year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement  they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap  particularly in light of what we  re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research   i  d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron  there are several things i see we can do   1  give him a mid  year pay increase to move him closer to market  i  m not  sure this is the best way to go  especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase   2  offer him more responsibility  what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team  with my move to  ebs  should we accelerate this  i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated  and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year  end  as part of the regular process  that takes into account his greater  responsibility   3  we have some people that we  re trying to get under long  term  3  yr   contract with a 12  month notice clause  obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up  front compensation for being handcuffed   we  ve not had a lot of success with these here in london  and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job   i  d value your thoughts on this   thanks   dale,0

 urgent contact  from the desk of  dr tom eke   e  mail  dr  tomeke  spinfinder  com  lagos  nigeria   attn   request for urgent business relationship   it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter  first  i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction  this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and  top secret    though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried  considering the fact that we have not met  each other before   but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day  we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction  as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you   so we decided it is best using the e  mail  which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000   however  let me start by introducing myself properly  to you  i  am dr  tom eke  a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources  d  p  r  and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals  i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence  i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel  our duties  include evaluation  vetting  approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d  p  r e  t  c  in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds  the source of this funds is as  follows  in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us  400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt  during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over  inflate the  total contract sum from us  400 million to us  431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us  31 miilion amongst ourselves   the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us  431 million for us  as the contract sum   and the sum of us  400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done  but  since the companies are entiltled to us  400 million  dollars only  we are  now left with us  31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves  but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel  we cannot do  this by ourselves   as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau   civil service  laws  from opening and  or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service  making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now  i have  therefore  been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us  31 million  hence we are  writing you this  letter  my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf  you or your  company will retain 20  of the total amount  us  31  million   while  70  will be for us  officials  and the remaining 10   will be used in  offsetting all debts  expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer  needless to  say  the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous  in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust   you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below   a  our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b  that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c  that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody  or any form of blackmail   d  that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20  from  the total amount   please  note that this transaction is 100  legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you   we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction  there is no cause for alarm  i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us   transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives  here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day  thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria  this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future  so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty  i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you   please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e  mail address   i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction  i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me  your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002  thank you and god bless   yours faithfully   dr  tom eke   n  b  please be informed that this business  transaction is 100  legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering  this is a  complete legitimate business transaction    ,1

 spanish power option pricing  hi paul  cassim   further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options  that we may use to  capture short  term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or  broken  i have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the  value   arbitrary distribution  the first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average  of the q 2  q 3 swap into a volatility equivalent  this is achieved by fitting  a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard  deviation  the graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed  yesterday  in this example  the annualised volatility is coming up as  approximately 23    pricing  implied volatility  the pricing is as for a regular asian option  the payoff depends on the  average of the daily prices for spanish power for q 2 and q 3  the valuation  using 23  volatility is showing about 15  3 pta per kwh   i will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward   regards   anjam  x 35383  spreadsheet ,0

 a better investment than the stock market   all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h  r  3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000  please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions   parents of 15  year old  find  71  000 cash hidden in  his closet   does this headline look familiar  of course it does  you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program  usa    and reported elsewhere in the world  including my neck of the woods   new zealand   his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15  year  old  sons closet  nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash  five  dollar bills  twenties   fifties and hundreds  all neatly rubber  banded in labelled piles    my first thought was that he had robbed a bank   says the 41  year  old  woman   there was over  71  000 dollars in that bag   that  s more than my  husband earns in a year    the woman immediately called her husband at the car  dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered  he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up  little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet   as it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via e  mail  a type of   report  to e  mail addresses that he obtained off the internet  everyday  after school for the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom    i just got the e  mail one day and i figured what the heck  i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out   says the clever  15  year  old   the e  mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one   5 dollar bill to each person on the list  then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down  and finally to add your name to  the top of the list   the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five  dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5  address list   i get junk e  mail all the time  and  really did not think it was going to work   the boy continues   within the first few days of sending out the e  mail  the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video  game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing  5 bills    about a week later i rode  my bike  down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it  there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the  post office  counter  i thought i  was in trouble or something  laughs    he goes on   i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me  i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all   over  the next few weeks  the boy continued sending out the e  mail   the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet  barely had time for my homework   he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the  5 bills for twenties   fifties and hundreds    i didn  t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack  i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money  and he was outside waiting for me  one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it  but i just rode to the next  bank down the street  laughs    surprisingly  the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid  the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so  called  chain  letter  the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain  letter at all  in fact  it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws  title 18   section 1302 and 1341  or title 18  section 3005 in the us code  also in  the code of federal regulations  volume 16  sections 255 and 436  which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received   every five  dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read    please send me report number xyx   this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service  a report on how  to  for a  five  dollar fee    this is the end of the media release  if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your  71  000  please continue reading  what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net   you can use it too  just follow the simple instructions    be financially free like others within a year    before you  say  bull   please read the following  this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately  due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really  can make people money  the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal  their findings proved once and for all that there are   absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions  they are bound to make some  megabucks with only  25 out of pocket cost    due to the recent increase of popularity  respect this  program has attained  it is currently working better  than ever   note  follow the directons below  i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions   in order for all of us to be successful  many  many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many  i have been extremely successful using the  following company  they send out the offers  and all i do is accept money  for reports  then i send back to the people as soon as possible   this is what one had to say   thanks to this profitable opportunity  i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it  i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required  to my astonishment  i received total   610  470  00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in    pam hedland  fort lee  new jersey   here is another testimonial   this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it  but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my  25 on it  i followed the simple instructions  and walaa      3 weeks later the money started to come in  first month i  only made  240  00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of   290  000  00  so far  in the past 8 months by re  entering the program  i  have made over  710  000  00 and i am playing it again  the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything   more testimonials later but first   print this now for your future reference      order all 5 reports shown on the list below     for each report  send  5 cash  the name  number of the  report you are ordering and your e  mail address to the  person whose name appears on that list next to the report  make  sure your return address is on your envelope top left  corner in case of any mail problems   when you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5 reports   you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer   within a few days you will receive  vie e  mail  each of the 5 reports from  these 5 different individuals  save them on your computer so they will be  accessible for you to send to the 1  000  s of people who will order them from  you  also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case  something happens to your computer   important  do not alter the names of the people who are listed next  to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is  instructed below in step  1 through 6  or you will loose out on majority of  your profits  once you understand the way this works  you will also see  how it does not work if you change it  remember  this method has been  tested  and if you alter  it will not work    people have tried to put their  friends  relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money   but it does not work this way  believe us  we all have tried to be greedy  and then nothing happened  so do not try to change anything other than  what is instructed  because if you do  it will not work for you  remember   honesty reaps the reward     1     after you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and  remove the name  address of the person in report  5  this person  has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune   2     move the name  address in report  4 down to report  5   3     move the name  address in report  3 down to report  4   4     move the name  address in report  2 down to report  3   5     move the name  address in report  1 down to report  2  6     insert your name  address in the report  1 position   please make sure you copy every name  address accurately       take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on  your computer  do not make any other changes  save this on a  disk as well just in case if you loose any data  to assist you with marketing  your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you  with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk  e  mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much  more  there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going   method  1  by sending bulk e  mail legally  let  s say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will  assume you and those involved send out only 5  000 e  mails each  let  s  also assume that the mailing receive only a 0  2  response  the response  could be much better but lets just say it is only 0  2   also many people  will send out hundreds of thousands e  mails instead of only 5  000 each    continuing with this example  you send out only 5  000 e  mails   with a 0  2  response  that is only 10 orders for report  1  those 10  people responded by sending out 5  000 e  mail each for a total of 50  000   out of those 50  000 e  mails only 0  2  responded with orders  that equals  100 people responded and ordered report  2   those 100 people mail out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of 500  000 e  mails   the 0  2  response to that is 1000 orders for report  3   those 1000 people send out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of 5 million  e  mails sent out  the 0  2  response to that is 10  000 orders for report  4   those 10  000 people send out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of  50  000  000  50 million  e  mails  the 0  2  response to that is 100  000  orders for report  5  that  s 100  000 orders times   5 each   500  000  00  half million   your total income in this example is   1       50  2       500  3       5  000  4       50  000  5       500  000         grand total   555  550  00  numbers do not lie  get a pencil  paper and figure out  the worst possible responses and no matter how you  calculate it  you will still make a lot of money   remember friend  this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5  000 you mailed to  dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100  000 e  mails each or more  there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting  believe me  many people will do just  that  and more   method  2  by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise  placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response   we strongly suggest you start with method  1 and add method  2 as  you go along  for every  5 you receive  all you must do is e  mail them the  report they ordered  that  s it  always provide same day service on all  orders  this will guarantee that the e  mail they send out with your name  and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report    order each report by its number  name only  notes  always  send  5 cash  u  s  currency  for each report  checks not  accepted  make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil  on one of those sheets of paper  write  the number  the name of the report you are ordering  your e  mail  address and your name and postal address   place your order for these reports

jody about receiving   junk mail   i made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the  population and percentages involved  i  knew  it wouldn  t work  jody  totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in  with both feet  i made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old   i told you so  on her when the thing didn  t work  well  the laugh was on  me  within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses  within the next 45  days she had received total  147  200  00     all cash  i was shocked   i have joined jody in her  hobby    mitchell wolf  chicago  illinois   not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my  mind to participate in this plan  but conservative that i am  i decided that  the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i  wouldn  t get enough orders to at least get my money back    i was  surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with  orders  i made  319  210  00 in the first 12 weeks  the nice thing about  this deal is that it does not matter where people live  there simply isn  t a  better investment with a faster return and so big    dan sondstrom  alberta

 a basic idea of price  offer matching clauses  vince   here is the basic idea i was alluding to   suppose a car dealer promised to  match any advertised price   then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind  and so on  until all  dealers advertised they would  match any advertised price   now  consider one  of these dealer  s decision to perhaps lower his prices  if he does so   everyone will immediately match his price  so his market share will remain  unchanged  at whatever it was before  but his revenues  and all other dealers  as well  would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction  so  the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars   now  suppose a limited partnership  where the partners contract to  control   who they are in business with  by putting a  right of first refusal  clause  into the partnership  s papers  whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares  now  suppose you are an  outsider  considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership  you know if your offer is a  good  one from your  perspective  offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return  the  existing partners will match it  and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid  from your own pocket  for your due diligence  conversely  if  you offer too much for the shares  then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid  in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners  so  you  basically  don  t make an offer  so  a partner  s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them  the  right of first refusal  clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares   essentially  illiquid   clayton,0

 re  estimating tail of distribution and additional risk measures  naveen   the  analytical var  approach is working for equity portfolio   it gives us the tool to examine the tails  behavior for this portfolio and  calculate  expected tail loss    the same should be done for commodities portfolio as well   meanwhile  as we discussed  we can give some rough estimates of the losses  corresponding to percentiles other than 5 th   look at the figure below  you can see var numbers for 5   1   0  5  and 0  1   calculated with  1  simulations  100 thousand simulations    2  analytical var  gamma  delta positions representation   1  and 2  are very close because there are not many options in equity  portfolio   3  simulations  1000 simulations  to calculate 5  var  then in order to  approximately estimate var for 1   0  5  and 0  1   i scaled 5  var with factors corresponding to normal distribution  for  example  norminv  0  001  0  1   norminv  0  05  0  1  for 0  1     the result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good  just 5   different from the correct number    we probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio  until we have proper methods implemented   tanya tamarchenko  02  28  2001 01  17 pm  to  wenyao jia  hou  ect  debbie r brackett  hou  ect  ect  cc  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  subject  re   analytical  var implementation in risktrac  debbie   i am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of   analytical  var in risktrac   here is why this effort is very important   1  we need to calculate var for other percentile but 5  1  or even 0  2  as  mentioned by rick buy   and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations   2  we need to present additional risk measures  such as mean tail loss  to  the board   the analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested  already so there will be no problems  with the algorithm itself   we need to get together and discuss it implementation   what do you think   tanya,0

bharati  enron  com  cc   subject  re  comments  rakesh   thanks for your input  they are quite useful for helping me clarify my own  thinking  the following are my responses to your comments and  clarifications  the   ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you   1  the money is being set aside to avoid negative values  it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node  anyhow  we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes  at that cross  section of time as the risk  free asset pays in all states of  nature  this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization  thus  for the typical project we have  the value of risk  capital may be extremely high  as we are not following a tail  based norm  anymore     i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement  i do this  because i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows   this  is discussed in my first memo   this clearly provides a conservative  estimate of firm value  and a measure of risk capital that is too high   from the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital   it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at each  node is positive  also  one might want to set the level so that the pv is  positive in say 98  of all nodes   2  your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive  if so  we are only issuing risk  free debt  also  a  project with a single negative value at each cross  section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity     again  this is a very conservative initial estimate  when the model is  refined  you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project  defaults a certain percent of the time   3  it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate  which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment  by equating the  variances   it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such  an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence     i am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect  on volatility  in fact  i think the process requires only one iteration  when the volatility is independent of the discount rate  again  the idea  is that we calculate the volatility of the project  s value calculated with  an initial discount rate  using the calculated volatility and the stock of  a comparison firm  calculate a more appropriate discount rate  if the  volatility of the project  s value is not affected by the change in discount  rates then we are done  if  however  the change in discount rates changes  volatility  then we may have to iterate   let me know if this makes sense     also  our project has a finite life and the market  based assets will have  infinite lives  in the light of this fact  how will we define the relevant  variance  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment     this is a good point  i was thinking in terms of the average variance   but this may not be correct  actually  we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation  typically  firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate   which clearly does not make sense  this requires some additional thought     4  finally  our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital  setting risk capital to zero  this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate     this is correct  my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate  there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure  what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating     gas field case  to facilitate your thinking  we are providing a gas field example below   we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field  a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning  production will be autocorrelated  as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves  we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value  there are fixed and variable  operating costs  it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem     this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing   hence  there is no need to be concerned about risk capital  other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property   to value the property  assuming all  equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable  e  g   a traded mlp   the risk  adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field   please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk  adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward     let me know when you would like to discuss this                                    on another topic  is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant  where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non  recourse debt  we would like  the following information   1  the value of the power plant  or purchase price   2  the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract   3  some information about the pricing of gas  power swaps and options   about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt  i don  t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances  however  my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study   let me know when you want to discuss these issues   thanks   sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin  texas 78712  1179  512  232

 re  convergence of the research model  i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the  number of simulations we use  this question  i think  is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve  because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway  here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes   correlations  etc    this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors  when the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable  to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve  what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity   i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss  for a simple portfolio with one counterparty  sithe ind power  for different  number of simulations  10  100  1000  10000  100000  using old research  credit model   you can see how the result converges and the relative error  compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate  in  the  attached file   tanya ,0

 option pricing discrepancy for j  c  penny transaction  amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the  option prices calculated by the credit  reserve model and the stand  alone  spreadsheet model used in deal pricing  the discrepancy can be traced to  differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic  differences   the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments  the  credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by  assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the  underlying contract  which is a very reasonable assumption   the stand  alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option  expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying  in the  jc penney transaction  the monthly options were assumed to expire in the  middle of the contract month  when in reality the underlying monthly  contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months  the  stand  alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the  user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal  at present   seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly  options and not a strip of daily options  in which case we would require  estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the  credit reserve model   regards   rabi de,0

 var for metals  it is my preference to have an aggregated var methodology for the metals  business as soon as possible  version la   i do not want to poison progress  with my opiniion  but i think that the critical first step is to find a way  to aggregate positions in coarse buckets  perhaps sacrificing precision for  speed  based on  rules  that oerations can deliver  research can stand behind  and commercial will accept   and using an equally coarse var calculation   the equivalent of ad  hoc var   that can be delivered to the  official books  and records  on a daily basis  this i believe would be acceptable for a 2  3  month time frame  at which time we get versionlb  as opposed to waiting 2  3  months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim   ultimately  i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable  by 1  1  01  this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i  cannot conceive of a better way  please let me know if this is consistent  with your understanding  a critical point from my perspective is that the mg  commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making  this happen and willingness to accept the consequences  i look for you to  take the lead as leader of the integration to do so  if you need any input  from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know  as i  alluded to on the phone  the people in houston that have been involved in the  var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of  var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding  by all parties as their responsibilities  given the distance and the newness  of the metals personell  i fear that this could set us all up for some  surprises and some very uncomfortable communication  much of which is not  entirely necessary   thanks  ted  eric gadd  07  21  2000 11  46 am  to  ted murphy  hou  ect  ect  bjorn hagelmann  hou  ect  ect  cc  richard sage  lon  ect  ect  subject  attached fax  ted and bjorn   we plan to release draft recommendations on metal position limits by close of  business on 24 july and have asked vince to prepare a v  r computational  methodology prior to the 7  8 aug bod meeting ,0

 extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  cera  insight  title  extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url  http    www 20  cera  com  eprofile  u  35  m  2184  overview  a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union   s gas  directive  this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004   05   czech republic  estonia  hungary  poland  and slovenia   and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade   bulgaria  latvia  lithuania  romania  and slovakia  in cera   s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor   s point of view   the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two  day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november   many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy  the  results have been mixed  particularly in the utility industries  the 1998 gas  directive  adopted in august 2000  now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries  while providing a road  map to guide them   the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following    legal framework and regulation  the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe  as a result  in all  candidate countries in 1999   2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive  regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country  although  issues of staffing  financial autonomy  and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved    third  party access  tpa  and long  term take  or  pay contracts  all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition  therefore  all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation  although the  commission favors regulated tpa  the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases  in particular  the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long  term take  or  pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition  russian gas is for the most part sold to  single  traditional state  owned operators that dominate their internal  markets  a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment  this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers  article 25 of the directive  provides for   a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take  or  pay  obligations  this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry   furthermore  article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier  to those with an     emerging gas market  status      or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state  most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union    price cross  subsidies  residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers  in  various countries  tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled  but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce   this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices  all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross  subsidies as part of sector reform  but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult  as table 1  indicates  price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid  decade  but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform  the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu  complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame    unbundling  most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization  to date  unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries   in the future  the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation    structural unbundling  8  of the businesses  and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly   table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries  as the  table shows  the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive  whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave     end    follow above url for full report   come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001   shooting the rapids   strategies and risks for the energy future  in houston  february 12  16   2001

 re  generation earnings model  michelle   i agree with you that we need to run at least 500 iterations  but i did not  realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations  helen and i talked  earlier about  using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and  run the parts separately on different processors  then aggregate the results   this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time  looks like  we have to do it this way now  buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem   in addition  we might want to re  consider if writing the code in vb is  optimal   i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast  if not faster  as c   but some re  assurance from it group on this issue is helpful   best   alex  from  michelle d cisneros  ect 04  09  2001 02  52 pm  to  alex huang  corp  enron  enron  cc  gary hickerson  danielle romain  subject  generation earnings model  hi alex   danielle and i were talking to david m  today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results  last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations  the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run  to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days  we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations   we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using  do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process   thanks   michelle  x 35435  hi alex   danielle and i were talking to david m  today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results  last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations  the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run  to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days  we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations   we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using  do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process   thanks   michelle  x 35435,0

 petrochem desk  i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals  as it turns out  christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader  previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags  unfortunately  the group had a rough p  l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof  when asked about the fundamentals group  christian indicated that they  d only been around about 3  4 months and are not yet well  suited to curve building  john nowlan is indeed the head of the group   from a timing perspective  i told christian that it would probably take at least 6  8 weeks to develop a curve  especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers  fundamentals  as was suggested yesterday during our meeting  a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component  e  g   crude oil  would provide a great beginning point   we could then potentially strengthen  augment this relationship with other key factors  e  g   supply and demand terms  borne out of our market research   nelson,0

you can read  scientific word files  the dissertation hasn  t been reviewed by les or  the  external yet  although its been at forc for 2 months  i think that the  empirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to  both our company  s businesses  although i ultimately didn  t have the time  to  explicitly  price the jump risk  premium which i conjectured is possibly  implicit in the prices of exchange  traded electricity futures  options   rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a  rough assessment  with a little bit of further work  but not too much  be  made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets   in other words  i assumed spot jump  risk to be undiversifiable  and  essentially devoted 2 theoretical chapters to   1  proving that a jump  diffusion trading model is  incomplete    synthesising  the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory    note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with   term structure  securities as in the hjm w  jumps papers of shirakawa and  das and   2  deriving an explicit risk  adjustment process for  implementing  the  price  of jump  risk using a jump  diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth  process  ie  a jump  augmented production economy approach in the spirit of  cir  bates  ahn whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition  means that i have to capture mean  reversion via the futures volatility  function  and jumps are less easy to calibrate  any suggestions   regards  bernard       original message

 pserc denver meeting  vince   the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting  and boring  pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members  its research  program consists of three stems  markets  transmission and distribution   and systems   enron  s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem    in morning of the first day  researchers from universities  presented their project proposals  i found some of them  quite interesting  for example  shmuel oren  fernando alvarado   tim mount  of cornell  propose to study  market redesign  incorporating  the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market  design   shijie deng  s  oren et al propose to study  power asset  valuation model in a market  based and reliability  constrained electric  power system   the first got funded but the second did not   in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their  own discussion  i went to the academic discussion and lance the  industry one  i hope my presence there did not make things worse  for  the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion   the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants   the proposal process goes as follows  researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee  no industry participantion  it seems  to me    each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4  the  selected  proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry  industry then  gets to vote which proposals get funded  however  some researchers were  very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process  there were  accusation of self  ranking  communication between stem committee and  member schools breaking down  and so on  some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it   the arguement was  then it was a waste of our time to write proposals    which i found quite amusing    all in all  i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers  pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process  which is hard to believe  also   the communication among university researchers  between stem committee  and member schools  and most importantly  between researchers and industry   are not smooth as all   since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members  the  right   projects may not get funded  too many participants also make the decision  process very indecisive and quite painful to watch  lance can comment on  this better   they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which  made the voting a less authoritive   i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc  price tag is   40  000  per company per year   if we find some projects interesting  we can sponsor  the schools in the form of summer interns  the schools claim that most of the  fund  goes to support students anyway   alex,0

 re  tom halliburton  dear all   a few words about tom  he is a power engineer type who has previously worked  at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including  asset planning and hydro scheduling  he was hired by ei structuring to  oversee modeling efforts using sddp  henwood  etc  because of the recent  implosion at ei apache  tom  s group has effectively evaporated  and thus he  is looking for a new home  he has some finance background from having to  do asset evaluation for utility rate filings  he has almost no options  experience  he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or  problems   clearly the most obvious fit is with my group  but the idea is for you all to  see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects   and  as usual  the personality fit is the other aspect to examine   this is meant to be casual  if the consensus is positive  then i will explore  the formalities of such a transfer   thanks   grant ,0

 california on the brink   cera alert  cera alert  december 13  2000  title  california on the brink  cera knowledge areas  western energy  n  american power  n  american gas  california on the brink  the california stalemate  california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit  worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the california market  while numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california  s utilities  the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation  the current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation  the collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible   western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer  perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis   regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases  the california public utilities commission denied  the requests of pacific gas  electric and southern california edison to end  their rate freezes  forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy  this has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market   the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry  however  there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole  wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled  in the necessarily political process that will follow  it is  possible that  as has largely been the case so far  the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws   in the six months since california  s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets  regulators have done little to address the underlying problem   rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage  establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses  efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers  indeed   several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions  these include price caps  repeated  changes to market rules  attempts to seize generator profits  and a  challenging siting and permitting process   medicine worse than the illness  several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base  regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall  the void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms  but not the cause  of  california  s electric market woes     challenging siting and permitting  despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants  power  plant developers still face high hurdles  local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities    price caps discourage investment  state and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market  especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state    repeated rule changes  frequent rule changes in the iso markets  including  the price caps  confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development    calls for refunds  despite reports by the power exchange  the iso  and the  ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  california markets  state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market  calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development    facility inspections  recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust   cera  s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west  are not guaranteed  to make a profit  prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants  decommissioning of  older units  demand growth  and numerous other difficult  to  forecast factors   california  s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state   despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special  limited  term capacity payment  cera estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001   in addition  the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest  therefore  three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage   the road to recovery  there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall    encourage new build  supply must be part of the answer  this requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build  while in principal  some have been taken  such as new fast track approval  the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself  for now  there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness     stabilize investment climate  utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power  this provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build    move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios  one of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence   and even discouragement  of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state  particularly for residential and small commercial customers  with  the market at a peak  however  now is in one sense a sub  optimal time to move  toward term contracting  yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions  including new supply build and demand side investments  if  they end up above market  they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices  a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments    encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response  although  originally a feature of california  s market design  most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates  exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response    encourage market mechanisms that dampen the  boom bust  characteristic of  the market  whether in the form of a capacity payment  a reserve requirement   or a minimum term portfolio requirement  the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment  such a structure can help dampen  but not eliminate   future price volatility    avoid continuously tinkering with the market  while the market does need to  be restructured as described above  it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long  term  contractual market for power in california  continually tinkering with the  market structure  such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july  only serves to undermine confidence in the market  california needs to  do its best to develop a long  term solution and then let the market run its  course    allow for greater environmental flexibility  the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions    free purpa power plants to generate  relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational  but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power     end    this cera alert will be available in pdf format within

 re  fw  pserc nuggets related to market stem  hi vince and happy new year  good to hear from you and i can understand being busy  i am myself trying to  balance my commitments here   like any research consortium pserc is trying to provide value to its members  while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition  we are  definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the  members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual  members could see way to convert to proprietary tools  the work that shijie  deng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good examples   as to my trip  thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself to  get back friday night so i will save my visit for another time   i will tell my son about the spring interviews at cornell  hopefully this  time he will not miss it   regards  shmuel       original message       from   to   cc   sent  monday  january 08  2001 1  40 pm  subject  re  fw  pserc nuggets related to market stem     hello shmuel      thanks for your message  the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were   extremely busy   and i could not focus on pserc issues  i shall consult a few people in   enron on this subject and get in   touch with you  our concern right now is that the results of research are   widely shared with   our competition      i am out on the 19 th  but the 20 th would work for me  i would be glad to   cover the cost of your austin   to houston trip      regarding your son  the analyst  associate program will interview again  on   the campus   in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him               shmuel oren  on 12  19  2000 01  40  02 pm     to    cc   dennis ray        subject  fw  pserc nuggets related to market stem       hello vince   happy holidays    i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining   pserc  as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a   transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry   members within the last year  consequently  our business processes are not   well developed  one of the problems we are facing is the balance between   the   electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested   in market related research  i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we   have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of   market related research  i already have a verbal commitment from people at   electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc  with members like   electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects   such as the one that shijie deng proposed  not funded in this round     please   let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron  i am   going to be in austin on january 19 to participate at a puct hearing and   could come through huston for a visit  attached are some items that i   shared   with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as   well    regards  shmuel           original message        from   shmuel oren    to   power systems engineering research center    sent  tuesday  december 19  2000 9  47 am   subject  re  pserc nuggets related to market stem        the following are 3 items that demonstrate the impact of pserc research   in    the market stem area        1  on december 12  i  shmuel oren  testified at a hearing in san   francisco    before the blue ribbon panel  chaired by alfred kahn  for the that is    investigating the implications of uniform price vs  pay as bid auctions   in    the california px  as part of my testimony i presented a movie produced   by    tim mount and bob thomas that show results of an experimental economic   study    showing how bidders respond by raising their bids in a pay as bid   auction     following is an acknowledgement i received        dear shmuel           thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san    francisco  your presentation was very informative and valuable to all   the    panel members and other participants  the panel greatly appreciates  your    involvement in this important project           thanks again     natalie efland          2  a recent e  mail from the texas puc       professor oren  i hope you and your family are doing well  we are   seriously    considering your help and advice to facilitate the commission  s final    decision regarding retail competition in ercot        i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholders filled an application   for    approval of the ercot protocols in november  we received comments   including    list of issues on november 22 and reply comments on december 1  staff   will    draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their    discussion on december 13  there will be a pre  hearing on december 15   when    parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the   end    of first week in january  there will be a hearing on january 16  followed    with another hearing if needed  parties have asked the commission to    finalize its decision by mid march        to give you some more background  i have to mention that almost most of   your    suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols     except for problems with intra  zonal gaming regarding congestion   management    and pay  as  bid compensation for selected ancillary services  a few    additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and   congestion    management  stakeholders are still working toward more load   participation    in ercot market  however  the main problem is the fact that market    pilot    that covers 100  of wholesale  but only 5  of retail load  will be open   on    june 1  2001 based on a version of the protocols locked on august 1    2000      that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson    consulting   that version does not include some of your recommendations   to    address market design flaws  the full version is highly possible to be    implemented by january 1  2002 when market for 100  retail competition  is    scheduled to open  given this gap  some parties have recommended not to    implement incomplete protocols and wait for full implementation by   january    2002  in other words  they say let  s go ahead with 5  pilot retail  load     but wait for full design implementation before allowing 100  wholesale   load     and retail load  be subject to the rules of the game described in the   final    protocols        thanks        parviz adib  ph  d     director of market oversight division    public utility commission of texas    1701 n  congress avenue    p  o  box 13326    austin  texas 78711  3326    ph  no   512  936  7365       3  the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec 13  puct    hearing  this segment describes the commision  s deliberation on an  agenda    item addressing the possibility of instituting price caps as part of the    ercot protocols   see reference to my involvement in the next to last    paragraph        docket no  23220  petition of the electric reliability council of   texas    for approval of the ercot protocols   discussion and possible action     parviz adib  jess totten  keith rogas  and tammy cooper    chairman wood turned to page 2 item number 3 of the draft order   identifying    issues  recommending that the word  including  be changed to  other  than    in    the parentheses  he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two    mechanisms  which are bid caps and price caps  but would not mind having    parties focus on what other protections might be used  commissioner   walsh    would say  including  but not limited to  because she does not think it   is   a    bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a fail  safe    mechanism  it  s kind of like the stock market suspending trading when    something crazy happens  they could consider a maximum scenario  such  as     we don  t think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle   it      whether it is  1  000 or  99 or whatever it is  they could consider   whether    to put into the protocols a self  enacting price cap  while not  expecting   it    to happen  if it did  you don  t have to declare it an emergency and have   the    commission have to act  chairman wood asked if they could leave the    question without the parenthetical at all and just say  what protections    should be added to avoid extreme price spikes   commissioner walsh    reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility   of    unacceptable price spikes  she would like for them to have their own    fail  safe mechanism that is self  initiating as opposed to leaving that  to    having someone have to come in and act  commissioner perlman stated  that   he    thinks the california  type price caps is what the concern is about  he    thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those  but he thinks the   point    commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one  he had not thought    about the circuit breaker idea  and it might have some merit  he agreed    that it was worth considering something like that  then the question    becomes what the level is  chairman wood suggested the wording  what    self  implementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes     commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about  250    price caps  commissioner walsh agreed  but noted that if the unexpected    happens we should be prepared  commissioner perlman indicated that if    someone is making  10  000 in one particular hour that it probably does   not   b    enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them  it is not   something    they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether   they    are going to build a plant in texas  chairman wood stated that they  want   to    lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues        chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr  oren   was    assisting the commission  and asked if he could be brought back again     staffer dr  parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr  oren   and    that he is available to assist the commission further  chairman wood   noted    that dr  oren had helped people think outside the box without just   focusing    on california        the final wording was clarified to state  self  implementing mechanisms    and    to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question  the order   was    approved as amended

 precious metals var  jason   after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the  issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are  proposing  the var model  as i illustrated  is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions  prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the  silver mine  position into these inputs   i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price  the var model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period   to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm  in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict   if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help  to prioritise my time  i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and  tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice   rac will also assist in the process   please contact me if you have any further questions   kirstee  x 34529,0

ect  cc   subject  cme and catex  spotlight report  exchange products seeing slow trading  gavin souter  03  20  2000  business insurance  page 3  copyright  c  2000 crain communications  inc  all rights  reserved   exchange  based insurance products developed in recent years have  been somewhat slow to get off the ground   although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since  the mid  1990 s to cover insurance risks  none so far has posted a  significant volume of trades   few insurers  reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away  from the traditional insurance markets  where capacity remains  abundant and relatively cheap   as long as those traditional markets manage to weather major  natural catastrophes  the allure of the exchange  based products will  remain limited  observers say   also stifling the growth of the exchange  based contracts is the  limited number of contracts available  one expert noted  dealers  he  said  are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one  contract against another   although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products  that has  not been achieved  said morton lane  senior managing director   capital markets division at gerling global financial products in  new york   the main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products  he said  the only way  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified  portfolio of other contracts  and none of the exchanges currently  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that  hedge  he said   florida windstorm options  for example  cannot be bought and then  hedged in the same way that international business machines corp   stock options contracts can be hedged with ibm stock  mr  lane  explained   the exchanges might be more attractive to investors if  in addition to  natural catastrophe options  they included options on other risks  he  said  those might include  for example  satellite  aviation and crop  indexes  mr  lane said   for the insurance buyer  such exchange  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle  but  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable  they may represent a  good surrogate   he said   the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for  over  the  counter securitized deals  if there are regular issuers of  catastrophe bonds  mr  lane said   the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of  exchange  based insurance products  said sean f  mooney  senior  vp and chief economist at guy carpenter  co   the reinsurance  brokerage unit of marsh inc  in new york    the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not  looking for other ways of doing business   he said   at least in concept  the exchange  based deals are generally similar  to the mortgage  backed securities that have been a huge success  since they were introduced in the 1970 s   there is a belief that  alternative means of transferring risks will grow  but it is difficult to  predict when   mr  mooney said   currently  the trading that is taking place typically involves  established insurers and reinsurers  so the exchanges have not  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace  he said   guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities  exchange reinsurance products  the bce did not take off   however  and was suspended last year after two years of little  activity   the oldest of the insurance  related  exchange  based derivative  products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board  of trade  which began trading the options in 1996   initially  there was substantial interest in the options  but the soft  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge  catastrophe exposures  said carlton purty  an independent broker  at the cbot who trades in options   no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot  so far this year  he said  last year  there was increased interest in  the contracts because of hurricane floyd  but few contracts were  traded  mr  purty said    i think a major  major catastrophe will have to happen before they  really take off   he said   the contracts offer real protection  and options dealers are keen to  trade in a new niche  but the conventional insurance and reinsurance  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative  coverage options  mr  purty said   the catastrophe risk exchange  located in princeton  n  j   has  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in  mid  1996  and it is well positioned to expand  said frank sweeney   chief operating officer   catex initially planned to be a computer  based facility for  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks  and to build balanced portfolios   but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996  it  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance  mr  sweeney  said   although there was some interest in risk swapping  only a handful of  risks were posted on the system  and none was traded  mr   sweeney said   consequently  catex has become chiefly a  cash for cover   exchange  he said  noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange  include property catastrophe coverage  aviation and liability  coverages  catex also trades industry loss warranties  where  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry  loss over an agreed threshold   other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible  through the internet in november 1998  and late last year  catex  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks  allowing them  form groups whose members do business only with one another   since its inception  catex has completed about 450 trades   totaling  400 million in premium and more than  3 billion in limits   he said  catex  s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers   insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their  captives  mr  sweeney said    we obviously have a long way to go  but we are pretty satisfied  with what we have achieved so far   mr  sweeney said   the exchange sees increased activity after major losses  as cedents  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their  existing cover  he said  for example  mr  sweeney said  there was  a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last  year   last september  the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field  of insurance  related derivatives when it began offering weather  derivatives   thus far  420 futures contracts have been traded  said larry  grannan  senior director in product marketing at the cme   such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against  weather  related losses  for example  a utility may sell less power in  a mild winter  and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a  resultant fall in revenues   the exchange first offered heat  based indexes for atlanta  chicago   cincinnati and new york  in january  it added philadelphia  dallas   des moines  las vegas  tucson and portland  and it began offering  contracts based on cold weather   currently  most of the trades are between securities dealers  themselves  but  eventually  the contracts will likely be used more  extensively by utilities and insurers  mr  grannan said   in addition  the futures contracts could be used as hedges for  over  the  counter securitized deals  he said   copyright  2000 dow jones  company  inc  all rights reserved ,0
