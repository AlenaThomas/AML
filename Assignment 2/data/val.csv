( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

standard . com / today / state 2 . asp ? menu = 32  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the financial express , april 23 , 2001  godbole ' s report unearths absurd calculations , maharashtra could use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project , sucheta dalal  it is finally quit india time for enron . though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company ( dpc ) , informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light it deliberately uses expensive raw material ( ignoring world bank warnings ) , has worked on fanciful demand - supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .  in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .  the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .  the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .  also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .  - - -

in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .  "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added .  according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .  the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .  mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise , "" he added .  deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol .  moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda , which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .  asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

""  - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole  this could well be the real enron story  a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi  "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report  an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""  the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""  pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" .  the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .  "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .  the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .  subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""  since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .  the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required  strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .  after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' '  the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""  significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""  enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . ""  the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .  maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .  but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding : "" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . ""  but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?  with priya sahgal  making of a scam  ? 1992 : centre invites enron to set up ' fast track ' power project  ? dec 1993 : first ppa signed with mseb  ? 1994 : enron starts construction  ? 1995 : sena - bjp govt scraps enron  ? 1996 : state govt renegotiates project  ? 1996 : 13 - day vajpayee govt approves counter - guarantee  ? may 1996 : state cabinet clears ppa  ? may 13 , 1999 : phase i commissioned  ? jul 1999 : financial closure for phase ii  ? oct 2000 : mseb defaults on payment , subsequently stops paying monthly bills  ? feb 6 , 2001 : enron invokes central government ' s counter - guarantee  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - business standard , monday , april 23 , 2001  mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham  the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .  as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .  the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .  a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions",0

1659,"Subject: power trading  hi folks :  very glad to hear about the new developments . just to recap what we  discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up  trading operations and the contacts :  1 . licence to trade : regulatory people : i guess you know about this part  better than me .  2 . trading & risk mgmt : global risk mgmt oversight : john sherrif in london  has the overall responsibility outside western hemisphere . research group can  help with the structuring models used for trading .  3 . risk conrols : before trading group is operational , it needs to get the  authorization from the board of directors of enron along with total position  limits and possibly value @ risk limits . these limits are typically by  commodity type and by region . risk assessment & control ( rac ) under rick buy  performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to  these trading limits . ted murphy is the vp in rac overseeing the trading  operations . the value @ risk models come from the research group , but  day - to - day monitoring of the numbers is done by ted ' s group .  4 . credit risk : a credit reserve number is computed for each deal ( again , the  models are created by research ) and is transferred to the credit group under  bill bradford ( also in rac ) . this is basically like buying insurance from the  corp . , so that if there is a couterparty default , the loss is covered by the  reserve pool of the credit dept .  5 . legal : the name i was given is alan aronowitz for legal help .  6 . back office : initially can survive with excel spreadsheets . you should  contact the it though when the plans finalize to talk about systems .  australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations .  you can talk to paul quilky , the trader there to talk about these issues  ( mention to him that grant masson in research gave his name ) .  barry pierce in london was incharge of back office at the begin there .  i can coordinate for talking with people next week . give me a call monday if  possible . i hadn ' t the time to search for the presentation stuff today . will  do it next week .  krishna .",0

151,"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"" he noted that the only reason they haven ' t yet is that "" they were too stupid to ring - fence the parent "" and that "" their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it . ""  he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . ""  2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough  angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office .  3 . new generator construction  anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

3424,"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0

4878,"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0

"" that was my  motivation . the second problem was that the logos themselves , even if it  made sense to do them in gold , made the design too busy - a lot of the  appeal in these "" word "" mugs is the clean , linear look . finally , i think  lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances  that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will  display this mug on their desk or on their shelves .  i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance  terms will make it an interesting conversion piece - i ' ve never seen  anything like it in academics , let alone in finance . i think enron ' s  sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their  interest in the mugs to say "" what is this ? where ' d this come from ?

4060,"Subject: alliance info alert  ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis  * * omnibus order mobilizes ferc ' s entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority  * * to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities  * * streamlines regulation of wholesale market , energy facilities siting and  licensing  * * promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand - response bidding  * * order doesn ' t address price caps  * * meeting with western state regulators / officials set for april 6 , 2001 in  boise , idaho  ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed california and western energy markets . ferc proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification , licensing , and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce . ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity , as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions , as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines . the order , which sets new  precedent in its broadness , also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale - market  portion of demand - response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side . ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30 , 2001 .  effective immediately , ferc said in a statement , * the commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales ,  expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california  and the west , including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications , and urging all licensees to review  their ferc - licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity . *  among the actions ferc takes are to : 1 ) require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council ( wscc ) to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term ; 2 ) waive prior notice requirements for any on - site or  self - generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area ; 3 ) grant blanket  market - based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand - response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads ; and 4 ) broadening and extending through december  31 , 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities ( qfs ) to increase the availability of generating  capacity .  ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid , including an  increased rate of return on equity ( roe ) for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 , 2001 , or  november 1 , 2001 . other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act , and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction . on hydro issues , ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc - licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources .  in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure , ferc  asked for comments - again by march 30 - on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection , including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 .  increased roe , ferc said , will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 , 2002 , or november 1 ,  2002 . ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 - year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short - term and a 15 - year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights - of - way that can be of  service by november 1 , 2002 .  in his dissent to the order , commissioner massey argued the order focuses on  "" quick fixes , "" and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california . the order also "" fails to address price relief , "" noted  massey . massey also called for a full federal power act ( fpa ) section 206  investigation of california issues , which would allow for the possibility of  refunds . on transmission incentive provisions , massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no . 2000 . the financial provisions , he said ,  appeared to be "" just throwing money at the problem . "" while generally  disappointed with the order , massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order . many of the suggestions in the order are the "" same  actions as authorized last may , "" said massey . "" they were good ideas then ,  and they are good ideas now , "" he concluded .  for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted ,  chairman hebert said the order was designed to "" squeeze every additional mw  of supply available "" and to encourage the conservation of mw , and stressed  that ferc is "" doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems . ""  he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california , but noted that generation / transmission siting , and conservation  are generally state issues .  ferc ' s * removing obstacles * order is posted on its web site at :  citation : ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14 , 2001 , docket no . elol - 47 - 000 .  a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows :  electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days , the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way .  ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1 , 2001 would receive a  cost - based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10 - year depreciable life . projects in service by november 1 , 2001 , would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10 - year depreciable life . ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11 . 5 % , based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison .  system upgrades that involve new rights of way , add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1 , 2002 , would get a cost - based  rate reflecting 12 . 5 % roe , or al 00 basis point premium , and 15 - year  depreciable life .  facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid , which go into  service as required to accommodate the in - service date of the new plant would  get a cost - based rate that reflected a 13 . 5 % roe , or a 200 basis point  premium , if in service by november 1 , 2001 and 12 . 5 % roe if in service by  november 1 , 2002 .  for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments , for example , installing new  technology , ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point - to - point rate . ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply , or  alternatively , to roll these costs into the average system rate .  extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs - applicable throughout wscc - to allow increased  generation through december 31 , 2001 . the waivers were to expire on april  30 , 2001 . the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility . the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292 . 204 ( b ) , would be extended to december 31 ,  2001 .  additional capacity from on - site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc . through december 31 ,  2001 , owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back - up or self - generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 . ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market - based rates . ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales . quarterly reporting is  required .  allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers , as permitted by state law , and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale . ferc is granting blanket authorization , consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on - site generation and requires  similar reporting .  ferc ' s december 15 order on the california market directed , as a longer - term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day - ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue . ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this .  ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal , commercial , technical and  regulatory issues . safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand - response bidding programs . intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs .  requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales .  contract modifications for demand - response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand - response arrangements with their wholesale customers . as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections , ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand - response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements . clarifies that  demand - response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out - of - pocket costs .  interconnections  fpa section 210 ( d ) allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order : 1 ) is in the public interest ; 2 ) would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital , optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources , or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies ; and 3 ) meets the requirements of fpa section 212 .  ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210 ( d ) to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load . if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted , ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action .  longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long - term regional solution .  natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval  of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west . requests  comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline  construction to alleviate the present crisis , including increasing the dollar  limit thresholds for blanket certificates to $ 10 million , and for prior  notice authorizations to $ 30 million in order to increase the facilities  qualifying for automatic authorization ; offering blanket certificates for  construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance  pipeline capacity to california ; and offering rate incentives to expedite  construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this  summer on constrained pipeline systems .  hydroelectric power  ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental  protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation . requests  comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at  commission - licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources .  comments should consider : 1 ) methods for agency involvement ; 2 ) ways to  handle and expedite endangered species act consultations ; 3 ) criteria for  modifying licenses ; and 4 ) identification of processes that could be  implemented to provide efficiency upgrades .  oil pipelines  ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to  ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market .  conference with state commissioners  ferc will hold a one - day conference with state commissioners and other state  representatives from western states to discuss price volatility in the west  as well as other ferc - related issues identified by the governors of western  states . by notice issued march 16 , this meeting is scheduled for april 6 ,  2001 in boise , idaho .

2595,"Subject: preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !",0

5306,"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

5576,"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

4159,"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0

"" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use .",0

' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool ' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  "" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . ""  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry ' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .  "" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  "" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . ""  in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  "" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really  know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland ' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  "" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  "" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture  gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

1562,"Subject: california update 3 / 15 / 01  executive summary  ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt  ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short  for pg & e this summer  ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs  ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for california  california public utility commission rate increases  today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the  department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption ,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr ,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to  securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to  sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every  day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is  essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of  finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other  programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10  billion worth of state bonds .  davis & pg & e at odds  sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) ,  and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would  provide davis with even less negotiating power .  with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and  state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as  bpa .",0

and the sordid tale ends only  in 1997 , with the supreme court of india refusing to even  admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision , of december 1996 ,  which while commenting that "" this case has  highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence ,  political considerations outweigh the public interest and  the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to  justify its actions not only before the public but even before  the courts of law "" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the  project on the ( purely technical ) ground of res judicata , even  though new facts , new arguments , new evidence of the violation of the laws  of the land had been advanced by the petitioners .  the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and  recorded , despite the petitioners adducing the required  evidence , can only be termed as strange , perhaps bizarre .  abhay mehta ' s simple , factual documentation - in fact a chronological  narration - of all events , including the process of bending all  rules , of subverting the law for promoting a project involving  unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra , indeed for the whole of  india - is not only masterly , it is devastating .  it is a short , pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by  all thinking citizens of this country . barring the  concluding chapter , the epilogue , there are no personal comments , only  facts , disseminated from the original papers , mostly ' secret '  documents .  all documentation has been carefully , faithfully recorded , including  extracts from supposedly ' top secret ' minutes of cabinet  committee meetings ; and the specific violations of the law ( which were  opposed by a few public spirited civil servants , much to  their disadvantage ) have been pointed up . apart from an introductory  ' primer on electricity ' - introduced for the benefit of the  layman , explaining some technical issues relating to electricity  generation , transmission and distribution - and the background of the  events of 1991 , the foreign exchange crisis , and the aftermath of the  crisis , the other fifteen chapters , three appendices and fourteen  annexes of the small book ( of 226 pages ) packs in an enormous volume of  factual information . the strange saga of the enron  project , and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single  project poses for the country , need to be briefly recounted  here , for essentially , it is the coming generation which would have to  face the problem .  the mseb has contracted to buy - and if not used , to pay for - 2000 mw of  electricity ( for a period of 20 years ) from the  dabhol power company ( the legal entity set up by enron , as an unlimited  liability company registered in india , through a maze of  intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more ' front '  companies registered in various tax - free havens .  abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount  to $ 35 billion ( at 1998 exchange rates , around rs .  1 , 25 , 000 crores ) over the life of the project . one must record that : ( a )  crude oil / oil product prices have as of writing , more than  doubled since the above calculations were made . a per the ' doctored '  figures presented by the company ( and its advocate ) , the  charge per unit of electricity supplied , at the 1998 level of prices , was  to 4 . 39 cent ( per unit ) as ' capacity charge ' and 3 . 43 cents  ( per unit ) for ' energy costs ' .  the former is indexed to the us inflation rate , and the latter to  international fuel prices . the former may be assumed to have gone  up only marginally ( rounded to 4 . 4 cents per unit ) ; we know that fuel  prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 .  assuming the ' fuel costs ' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even  though international prices have more than doubled - we  may assume ( for 1999 ) energy costs of 6 . 85 cents per units , making for a  total payment of 11 . 25 us cents per unit of electricity  supplied by the dabhol power company ( dpc ) to mseb in late 1999 , in phase  i of the project .  within another two years , at 2000 mw , the annual offtake ( for 365 days x  24 hours / day ) would be 17 . 52 billion kwh ; and at  11 . 25 cents per unit , the total payment amounts to $ 1 . 97 billion annually ;  for 20 years , this workout to $ 39 . 4 billion .  this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or  capacity charge . at today ' s exchange rate - about rs . 43 . 5 per us  dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs . 175 , 000 crores ( as  compared to rs . 125 , 000 crores indicated by abhay  mehta ) . this is the cost to mseb in rupee ; and to the country in foreign  exchange as payment to just one project authority , for  supply of part of the power required in maharashtra .  the really significant point to note in this connection is that this  payment - and considerably more , depending on ( a ) future increase  in ' capacity charges ' depending on us inflation rate , and international  prices of lngaphtha ( for ' fuel costs ' ) , and ( b ) depreciation of  the exchange rate of the rupee vis - a - vis the us dollar - is obligatory ;  the assets of the mseb , the maharashtra government  indeed , all assets of the government of india ( present and future ) are  mortgaged to enron , by way of sovereign guarantees  extended by both governments .  the other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by  all independent indian experts as well as the world bank - the  enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric  company ' s and its own much cheaper thermal power  already ; in a postscript dated august 1999 , abhay mehta has indicated that  already , the mseb had stopped buying between 200  and 250 mw of power from tata electric ( available at rs . 1 . 80 per unit )  and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal  power station ( cost of this power being rs . 1 . 20 per unit ) , while forced  to buy more expensive enron power at rs . 5 per unit .  the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs . 460 crore per year .  this had in fact , been predicted earlier even by the world bank .  it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was  contrived , by a deliberate campaign of ' disinformation ' , of  blatant lies , of sidelining of expert opinion , not only of independent  experts but also the goi ' s own official advisers in this matter ,  namely , the central electricity authority as well as that of the world  bank , which was resolutely opposed to this project . the  detailed facts , the letters exchanged in the above context , the pressure  tactics adopted , the flouting of all procedures norms , even  statutory provisions of the electricity ( supply ) act , are all carefully  documented by abhay mehta .  mehta correctly concludes : "" we frequently blame external agencies - like  the world bank - for all our problems , when , as a  matter of fact , we ourselves are our own worst enemies . in the instant  case , the world bank not only advised the government of  india against the project , it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of  the total inadvisability of this project . in fact , one must note  here that in 1996 , neighbouring pakistan , which had entered into a  somewhat similar mou with enron , cancelled the project ( and  the power purchase agreement with enron ) , for a $ 670 million , 782 mw  residual oil - fuelled power plant , even though that  agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 . 4 us  cents per kwh over a 30 year period . ( note the  estimated rate of 11 . 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in  december 1999 , which works out to around rs . 5  per unit ) .  one could go on ; but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta ' s  crisp , factual , matter of fact narration of the enron  saga , and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the  story , about ' the next round of scams ' .  for quite some time , the ruling elite in india has been intent on  ' privatising ' all public enterprises ; and even ' utilities ' are no  exception . the ' unbundling ' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation  of all the ' profitable ' segments . all this - as per the current  ' disinformation campaign ' - is supposedly in the interest of  rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply .  the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the  government - by the torrent group - of the ahmedabad and  surat electricity companies at less than one - tenth of the market value of  the assets of thee facilities . again , much like the enron  saga , all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government  were overruled .  and , abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break - up of  power utilities into three segments , generation , transmission  and distribution , - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the  new thrust by the ruling elite , for reasons that do not require to  be spelt out .  though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad  and surat electricity companies , and of the break  up of the orissa state electricity board before him , yet his statement can  be stated today to be prophetic ; the upseb is now on  the firing line . the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the  upseb in protest of the announced up government decision  to trifurcate the upseb ; and the union minister of power , mr . rangarajan  kumaramangalam ' s statement that the upseb is a  loss making , inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities  after the trifurcation - need to be noted .  that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government ; that  tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up  government and not by the upseb ; that the upseb does not have the cash  even for routine maintenance as a result of the above  - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider . that the  remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and  restructuring , is not even to be debated . the whole idea is to privatise  the profitable segments , and to leave the public sector entity  with all the problem areas , including rural energy supply . it is against  this background that abhay mehta ' s book needs to be widely  disseminated , read , and its implications understood .  what is at stake is not a ' utility ' here or a psu there . what is at stake  is the future of some 80 per cent of the have - nots in this  country .  what is at stake is the ' pillory ' of the assets of the nation for private  aggrandisement .  arun ghosh",0

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power .  while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . ""  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . ""  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0

hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have  information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,  such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be  a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in  general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size  affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000  makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,  without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average  cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and  supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would  include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,  insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,  marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .  for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total  assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment  plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,  and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for  australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are  short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number  representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other  noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and  minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative  earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .  typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less  distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low  credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank  for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of  actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )  reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances  for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number  less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to  production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or  items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative  expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it  can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -  and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the  prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of  computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a  loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would  be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian  companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes  appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as  extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and  discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses ,  income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of  accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as  positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for  australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north  american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the  evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",0
