 re  mec  mark   steve  s comment has many merits  i think stinson gibner and grant masson   physics ph  d   s  can help to identify  academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims   on the other hand  even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in  their time estimates  the technology  they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous  potential payoffs  it make sense to  stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities   vince  steven j kean  ees  07  26  2000 05  11 pm  to  mark lay  hou  ect  ect  cc  rex shelby  enron communications  enron communications  ect  mike  mcconnell  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  philippe a bibi  hou  ect  ect   kenneth lay  corp  enron  enron  ect  fabricio soares  hou  ect  ect  subject  re  mec  i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2  3  years from commercial production  ideally  we could get that confirmation  from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest  in its success  their technology pitch sounded good  but i don  t know enough  to recognize the potential shortcomings  i want to feel comfortable that you  all feel this is real  then i would be happy to have me and my team spend  some time with them   to  rex shelby  enron communications  enron communications  steven j  kean  hou  ees  ees  mike mcconnell  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  philippe a  bibi  hou  ect  ect  cc  kenneth lay  corp  enron  enron  fabricio soares  hou  ect  ect  subject  mec  thank you for participating in yesterday  s meeting  we spoke with harvey and  jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart   there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early  development of their company  but it seems the one thing they want is the one  thing we also want  people  i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on  the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as  part of a potential investment and strategic relationship  given our  resource constraints  this would most likely be part of the organization that  sees the greatest strategic impact from mec  s development   mark  x 37408,0

 re  seminar series mug  barbara  i think you make valid points in your e  mail  the latest design you  sent me looks fine and meets with our approval  thanks   marge  barbara ostdiek on 08  17  2000 04  10  44 pm  to   marge nadasky   cc   subject  re  seminar series mug  at 03  58 pm 8  17  00  0500  you wrote    barbara  vince kaminski had forwarded me the artwork for the mug being   worked on   for the seminar series for review  comment  we in public relations were   wondering if you might be able to incorporate the enron logo in the design    could you please contact me and advise if this is possible   we tried to use both the enron logo and the rice university seal  it just  didn  t work  there seemed to be a few problems  the first was color  as  is  the mug will be black with metallic gold text  introducing the other  colors was distracting  our admissions department uses a black and gold  mug that is quite stunning and  it seems to go with  finance   that was my  motivation  the second problem was that the logos themselves  even if it  made sense to do them in gold  made the design too busy  a lot of the  appeal in these  word  mugs is the clean  linear look  finally  i think  lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances  that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will  display this mug on their desk or on their shelves   i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance  terms will make it an interesting conversion piece  i  ve never seen  anything like it in academics  let alone in finance  i think enron  s  sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their  interest in the mugs to say  what is this  where  d this come from    i  m hoping this version will be acceptable to you for our first shot at  this  please advise   barbara ostdiek,0

an uncertain future      after six years  profit from company  s power operations remains years  away  by elizabeth williamson  04  13  2000  the wall street journal europe  9   copyright  c  2000  dow jones  company  inc    nowa sarzyna  poland   from a small power plant humming among the  birches near the ukrainian border  enron corp  has staked its claim on  the polish energy market   yet after six years  the company is still seeking a mother lode   the houston  based energy producer and trader entered poland in 1994   nabbed one of the first power  trading licenses to go to a foreign  company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna  poland  s first  new  foreign  operated heat  and  power plant   other companies followed  including electricite de france  rwe ag of  germany  vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium   the prize could be a rich one  all of these companies hope to profit  as poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining  the european union   a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july  and the  country  s transmission links to markets east and west could make poland  the power  trading hub of central europe   but after six years in poland  enron has yet to earn a profit  net  income from nowa sarzyna  which is to begin commercial production later  this month  is at least five years away  power  trading operations might  generate profits next year  if the new bourse gets moving  but that is   one big question mark   says jarek astramowicz  enron poland  s  president   indeed  despite its promise  poland  s energy sector remains a  sizzling tangle of aging plants  archaic market agreements and complex   shifting regulations   enron  with  40 billion  41  69 billion euros  in annual revenue  is  an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers  but in a power  market as negatively charged as poland  s  the company also is an example  of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors  offline    these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks   says pawel kaminski  energy  sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw   but eventually they have to generate some  return    enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u  s  it  entered europe in 1989  setting up in london as the u  k   s energy sector  liberalized  it entered the nordic market in 1996  and today is the nord  pool  s largest  volume trader   enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant  and a further 29 months for construction   just four years after entering the u  k   enron finished its  1  875  megawatt teesside plant  teesside  s capacity and cost  at gbp 795  million  1  32 billion euros   are many times larger than nowa sarzyna  s   yet teesside was completed in only two  thirds the time  the company  declines to compare development times in various countries    i wouldn  t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia    says philip davies  regulatory and government  affairs manager at enron  europe in london   but obviously  given poland  s  planned economy  past   it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point    at nowa sarzyna  it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point  even though mr  astramowicz already knew the site   and the polish power industry  s rules   the nowa sarzyna plant was mr  astramowicz  s brainchild  and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal  a freelance energy  sector entrepreneur  before joining enron  mr  astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998   enron has spent  132 million to build nowa sarzyna  a 116  megawatt   gas  fired combined heat  and  power plant  quiet  clean and efficient  the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland  s belching  coal  fired  behemoths  when it starts up this month  it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid  the country  s high  voltage network  under a  20  year power  purchase agreement  or ppa  that enron won in 1997  steam  output goes to organika  the chemical company next door  and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna   the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80  financed by commercial  bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant  s concluded contracts    they were betting on their good name   says michael davies  a  partner with allen  overy  the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland  s lenders   they are pushing envelopes all the time    that is especially true in a market with 30  overcapacity  where an  energy law didn  t even exist until 1997   says peter bisztyga  emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london   because enron signed a ppa  they are ok      but  i  m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea    mr  bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant  but  he acknowledges  nowa sarzyna   allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it    in 1994  polish power plants weren  t for sale  energy asset  privatization  discussed for years  began in earnest only this year  by  2002  the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants  33 distribution companies and the polish power grid  a  12  000  kilometer national transmission network of high  voltage lines   the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys  8  4 billion  euros   but murky regulations have driven prices down    the regulations don  t promote competition and so you don  t really  know the price of electricity   says bengt wegemo  president of  vattenfall poland  earlier this year  vattenfall paid  235 million for  55  in warsaw  based elektrocieplownie warszawskie  promising  340  million in investment in the heat  and  power plant over the next 10  years   investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing   ultimately  170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse  setting the wholesale price of electricity  the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart  enron  the nord  pool  s largest trader  hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001   but first  say market experts  poland  s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse  and free up access to  poland  s distribution network   further  the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid  s power  purchase agreements  which  account for 70  of energy sales in poland  some state  owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing  when  prices are freed  these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn  t spend money to modernize   the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs  though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant  the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge    we are hoping that continuous  efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a  bigger  profit   mr  astramowicz says   another problem is cross  border power trading  where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid  also  known as pse  enron and others protest that pse shouldn  t compete with  electricity  market participants who contract with it for transmission  service   pse intends to stay in the trading business  says marek zerka  pse  s  vice president  in late march  pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany    this is great news   mr  astramowicz says   if this joint venture  gets access to pse  s cross  border transmission capacity    i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants    enron and others are pushing hard for that access   as soon as the  market becomes open  free and non  discriminatory  we will come out at a  decent profit   mr  astramowicz says   folder name  enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100  78  to

friday  may 26        by the end of april i was able to attract a top new student to work on   the    project     the other one for the coming year will be giuseppe  by spending the   summer    at enron  he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and    create an intellectual team here at stanford to look at these problems        i must move ahead soon to put the project in place

         i promised to send you an e  mail regarding possible dates for     a visit to enron  i delayed it for a week till my schedule was     clearer  let  s see if we can get a match with your schedule      mine is rather terrible          friday  21 st of april looks good  but april 23 rd is easter     sunday  so that may make it difficult for some people at enron     to be around  let me know if that is the case  i am willing to     visit then  because the week after that i am scheduled to be in     japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays          friday  19 th of may is the next possibility  but this probably     is too far out  the main problem is that i am operating within     a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this     research  this window closes by the end of april  and it would be     important for the student support funds to be in place then  so     that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top     talent  i am already reviewing files of students who have     approached me for phd advising  and i am in a mode of doing  soft     commitments to star  level students  to get this research and its     potential on their radar screen  top students are highly sought     after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this     competition          does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the     project and student support at stanford  if so  doing it before the     end of april is important for getting top people  if the visit can     happen after we get the ball rolling  then we can schedule it in may      i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets     going  please let me know what you think          best regards          nick,0
 linux   hit or miss   network world fusion focus  phil hochmuth  on linux  today  s focus  will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop   03  15  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  will linux be a hit or miss  on the corporate desktop   by phil hochmuth  so far this year  the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems  with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded  according to idc  a research firm based in  framingham  mass   linux was the fastest  growing server operating  system last year  with a 93  growth rate over the year before  linux  was the second most  shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt   capturing 24  of new licenses shipped   as for the embedded market  linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances  because the system can be modified to handle  specialized  dedicated tasks very well  companies such as cobalt  networks  picazo and progressive systems have announced linux  based  appliances  ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls   but what of the open source hacker   s dream of   linux on every desktop   8  sure  linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever  with  colorful  shrink  wrapped boxes of caldera  red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa  however  analysts have said that  linux   s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems   according to idc  linux currently runs on only 4  of u  s  desktops  the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong   analysts say  despite such factors as microsoft   s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux   even some linux executives are skeptical of their product   s desktop  future  recently  suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux   s future on  desktops  dyroff said    given the lack of applications available  we  really can  t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet   8  a recent survey by survey  com gives more hope for linux desktops   according to the survey of 1  640 enterprise network managers  open  source operating systems are used on 10  of desktops  with the number  jumping to a surprising 23  of enterprise desktops by 2002   despite the mix of numbers being thrown around  two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are  a standardized  easy  to  use graphical user interface  gui   and available applications   one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto  based eazel  which is designing a next  generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel  according  to eazel   s web site  the company   s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and   do it in a way that appeals to today  s linux users and to mere  mortals   8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives  and is  allied with the gnome project  which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years  eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year  with an intuitive  icon  based  file management environment  eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis  gnome and kde  and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for   regular  8 users  for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side   this development will be worth keeping an eye on   on the applications side  several office productivity suites have been  available for some time  such as sun   s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop  corel has also ported its office products  such as  wordperfect  over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system  while there have been recent rumors  started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde  that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux  microsoft officials deny this   while linux may never supplant windows as the industry  standard desktop   there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in

 industry giants can  t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc   the potential stored  value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people  of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored  value debit card accounts   one company is quickly entering a  2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi  national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching  in just a few months  this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long  term customers that could generate tremendous re  occurring revenues for many years to come   although you have probably never heard of this company  you may soon hear of it even if you don  t continue reading this message  that  s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u  s  within the next year   an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality  this company  s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you  since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don  t know this company or what they plan to accomplish  their stock is trading at rock bottom prices  but  if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years  this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments   the company that we  ll introduce you to today is  relay capital corp  pink sheets  rlyc   rlyc  which recently went public  is a multi  faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market  rlyc  s present product and service offerings include pre  paid stored  value cards  reward cards  employee payroll cards  gift  retail and affinity group cards  travel cards and funds transfer cards  these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally   just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn  t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner  in order to be successful  that company also needs to be truly innovative  have very strong partners  be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality  rlyc appears to be that company   below we  ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition   the potential stored  value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people  of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored  value debit card accounts   stored  value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e  commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities  the implications reverberate across industry segments  estimates suggest stored  value transactions could exceed  2 trillion in just a few years   rlyc  s focus is on providing stored  value cards to the un  banked and under  banked  these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account  debit card  the size of that group is staggering that  s about one  third of the nation  s work force   rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored  value card programs that make it easy  fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored  value cards as well as for the un  banked and under  banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards   but that  s not all  the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships  in this segment  relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer  who wouldn  t want that  the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under  and un  banked  collecting their pay  cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming  rlyc  s stored  value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem   rlyc  s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un  banked alike  lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u  s  cards  cards in foreign countries  and services bought through the cards  improved employee retention  improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc  various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system  while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms   rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year  rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc  click to go to their site   a leader in providing technical  craft and administrative staffing services to businesses  industry and government through locations in houston  dallas  long island  orlando  phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un  and under  banked populations   the potential market for this service is really big  it includes large employers  companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers   this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing  cutting  and mailing paper payroll checks  it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay  eliminate lost checks  stop payments and minimize fraud  but best of all  this should help to significantly boost rlyc  s revenues    150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u  s  send  16  3 billion a year back to mexico  with  150 billion being transferred internationally each year  remittances are a really big business  in times past  people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices  many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union  more recently  more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances   the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services  there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas  first  wiring funds across borders can be expensive  this can make it very cost  prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service  next there is the problem of logistics  both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company  s services  even if they both are able to do this  the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them  lastly  the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose  these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives  so  even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money  it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use   with money orders there is always the problem of mail service  although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service  this is not always the case in foreign countries  this is especially true in underdeveloped nations  where most remittances are sent  a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive  and  there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all  meaning that the sender  s family could go hungry or end up on the streets   what is the best way to send remittances   by far the most convenient  fast  safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored  value card  with this type of service  a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account  onto the card  via loading station  telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country   the process is extremely easy and cost  effective  funds can be added to the card  s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations  the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms  it could not be any simpler   rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year  rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2  000 pin  based stored value cards  the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2  000 new stored  value cards being put into circulation each month  this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services  moreover  though other programs it is working on  it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months   rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one  stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage  monthly fees  as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning  loading centers are retail locations  such as convenience stores  check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer  rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors  vendors and distributors  and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100  000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition   rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial  auto and sba loans  mortgages  all types of affinity group  loyalty  rewards  cards  pharmacy discount cards  certificates of deposit  cd  s   health savings accounts and health and life insurance  rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace  should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f  a  s  t     rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well  planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies  rlyc plans to fuel its growth  it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures  acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry   rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions  with corporate network  s assistance  it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty   rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account  hsa  market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp   an employee benefit and financial services company  to provide health saving account  hsa  stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre  tax dollars   health savings accounts  hsa  are tax  sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira  but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan  deposits are 100  tax  deductible for the self  employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa   this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non  elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account  creating a market of unprecedented potential  in fact  due to the rising costs of employer  sponsored health plans  it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees   experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp

 wall street  s dirty little secret     it was the spring of 1979   i was just a tall  goofy looking kid in middle school  with buck  teeth and freckles  each day in the  cafeteria  i walked from table to table     stealing other kids  lunch money   no  i didn  t rob them with a gun or a knife  i just made  them a little deal   let me borrow two dollars today   i said    and i  ll bring you five dollars next week   the investment  was too good to pass up  and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes  of course  when  next week  rolled around and i couldn  t pony up the cash   i promised to pay them even more the week after that   if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer   eventually the end of the year came and went  high school  started and with it came girls  and homework  and parties   and sports  and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year  s lunch money   i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid   and i didn  t even get beat up   hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn   first of all  greed is your number one enemy  you  re not  going to turn  2 into  5 in a week  so cash out when  you  re ahead  don  t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket   second  never trust an investment adviser of any kind   they are looking out for their own money  not yours   the  professionals   those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers  will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now  according to those guys  the longer you keep  your money in the market  the more money you  re going to make   ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is   never    in a sense  they are right  if you put  250  000 in an index  fund right now  you  ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years  but here  s the problem   do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich   hell no   you want the money now  so you can enjoy it  it  s hard to  make use of your fortune when you  re seventy years old  in a wheelchair  if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years  what would you do with it  where would  you travel  what kind of car would you buy   the fact is    youth is the best time to be rich   if your goal is to make quick profits in the market  volatility  is your ally  and stability your enemy  you want to see  those large upswings  two hundred points in a day  followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later  you don  t  care if the market went up or down 20  this year as long  it was unstable  that  s how you  re going to make the  money   what i  m talking about here is day trading   my father invests the traditional way  he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k  in the long term of 5  10 years  he makes money   the day trader buys or sells 5  000 shares of xyz for a   25  000 profit in a 5  10 minute trade  he acts quickly  taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock  and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours  sometimes within minutes   i can teach you how to do this  and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it  it  s not rocket science  and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started   society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training   the truth is  wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money   popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring  they don  t want the competetion  and they sure as hell  don  t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they  d charge you forty or fifty  dollars   they make their money only if you believe two lies   1  that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person   2  that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade   here is what the financial gurus in today  s society absolutely   positively do not want you to know     the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it  provided they spend  a few hours of studying   after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade  and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market  i  ve learned the following lessons     achieving financial success is incredibly simple     anyone can do it     it only takes a few hours to learn   when i discovered the secret to day trading  i didn  t become  wealthy overnight  if you want instant cash  drive to wal  mart   buy a ski mask and a shotgun  and rob your local bank  the  only way to get rich  quick or otherwise  is through  hard work  knowledge  and determination   after learning the fundamentals of day trading  i started  practicing the trading art itself  and the first few weeks  brought modest gains  the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living  and i was pulling  close to a six figure income  in less than three years with no  formal financial training  minimal effort and only

my mistakes  and from my successes  as i teach you the simple   secret formula for day trading that i  ve used profitably  year after year   the income of the day trader can be staggering  thousands

will give you a winning edge at this high  stakes game   average income of a day trader   5  average an income in excess of  500  000 per year  22  average an income in excess of  250  000 per year

 credit support value for mg and paperco  find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of  credit support for mg and paperco   my approach is as follows   1  assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps   2  spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors   3  calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap  the  default option  using black  s formula   4  treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows  that is  treat this value just like you would an annuity stream  by discounting back  this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk  reduced  rate  i find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two  npv  s   please give your comments  especially if this makes no sense to you   stinson,0

 interview  numerical methods  finance  dear tanya   it was a great pleasure to have met you  i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions   i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique  new and not reported elsewhere  this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch  the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance  they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation  mathematical analysis  physical interpretation  taylored numerical method development  software writting and develoment and data management   as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing  publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did   i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics  finance  software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem  absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution   please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine  vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism  multithreading  as well as hard parallelism  heterogenous network   this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used   in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview  from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration  pricing and hedging   i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating   best regards  joao,0

 re  fyi  uk var issues  vince   uk var breached the limit last week   uk traders asked us to review the correlations across uk gas and power as  well as the correlations across efa slots   we did part of the work last week   now we  ll update the correlations based on historical prices   tanya   richard lewis  10  08  2000 07  31 am  to  tanya tamarchenko  hou  ect  ect  cc  oliver gaylard

interesting results  i am on vacation next week  so  here are my current thoughts  i am contactable on my mobile if necessary   gas to power correlations  i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the  combined gas and power portfolio  and this raises an interesting point  at a  conservative 30  long term correlation  combined var is olmm less than  previously expected  so how does this affect the limit breach  strictly  speaking  we are still over our uk power limit  but the limit was set when we  were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var   a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk  gas and power books   can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in  portfolio var  ie  reduction  portfolio var  sum  power var  gas var     also  if i understand your mail correctly  matrix 1 implies 55  gas power  correlation is consistent with our correlation curves  and this reduces total  var by ol  8 mm   efa slot correlations  the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is  a separate issue  i don  t understand where the matrix 2 efa to efa  correlations come from  but i am happy for you to run some historical  correlations from the forward curves  use the first 2 years  i would  suggest   our original matrix was based on historicals  but the analysis is  worth doing again  your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important  these correlations are   closing thoughts  friday  s trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on  monday  we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve  and i  d  like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office  monday  week  before finalising this   regards  richard  tanya tamarchenko  06  10  2000 22  59  to  oliver gaylard  lon  ect  ect  richard lewis  lon  ect  ect  james  new  lon  ect  ect  steven leppard  lon  ect  ect

correlation scenarios  everybody   oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for uk  power  portfolio separately from uk  gas portfolio   first  if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas  curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas  only  the aggregate number will be affected  the changes you see are due to the  fact that we use monte  carlo simulation method   which accuracy depends on the number of simulations  even if we don  t change  the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers   we get slightly different result from the model   so  to see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power  we should look at the aggregate number   i calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves i got from paul  as the  weights along the term structure i used the product of price  position and  volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots  the results  are shown below   inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced  negatively definite correlation matrix  which brakes var engine   correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non  negative by  definition  and remains non  negatively definite if calculated properly based  on any historical data   here  according to our phone discussion  we started experimenting with  correlations  assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec  versus gas  i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results  in  addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did  you can see  the var numbers based on correlation matrix 1 and matrix 2  in matrix 1 the  correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix   i obtained this matrix by trial and error  matrix 2 is produces by naveen  using finger  s algorithm  it differs from original matrix across efa slots as  well  as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrix 1 does   concluding  we will look at the historical forward prices and try to  calculate historical correlations from them   tanya   oliver gaylard  10  06  2000 01  50 pm  to  richard

decomposition failed  not positive definite   0  9 cholesky decomposition failed  not positive definite   1  0 cholesky decomposition failed  not positive definite   peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix  s  integrity   interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0  2 the power var  increases which is counter to intuition  this implies that we need to look  into how the correlations are being applied within the model  once we can  derive single correlations from the term structure  is the next action to  understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the p  l  volatility in the spread option deals   from 0  4 onwards the var calculation failed   oliver,0

 re  preface for book  julie   the introduction looks fine  i have made some cosmetic changes   typos and split infinitives that slipped by   you can safely ignore most of  them   english is not even my second language   the corrections are in pink   vince   julie  on 08  01  2000 07  43  10 am  to   vincejkaminski   cc   subject  preface for book  vince     hope you are well     we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book  and  you kindly offered that you would provide this   is this still possible   we  realise that you are extremely busy  so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something  which is below  and if you want to review  change or re  write  the  preface  that would be very appreciated   let me know what your thoughts are     thanks   julie   we  re getting close       preface        one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives  pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible  to discuss  in  depth the models  and to show how they relate to each other   in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models  price a wide  range of energy derivatives  or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework   we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad  hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets  see also others who propose  consistent models     however  it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models  at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user  although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model  s  we prefer    we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs     in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters   in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book    in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black  scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing  which are used throughout  the book     in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices   as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices   we look at the well  know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion  stochastic volatility  and jump processes  discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated     chapter 3  written by vince kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp   discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets    this chapter builds on the previous one   it examines in detail the methods   merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2   examples from crude  gas  and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility     chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets   although such  curves are well understood and straight  forward in the most financial  markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves   in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments   we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets  the arbitrage approach  the econometric  approach  and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors     chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses   examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps  caps  floors and collars  as well as  energy swaptions  compound options  asian options  barrier options  lookback  options  and ladder options     chapter 6 investigates single and multi  factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives   closed form  solutions for forward prices  forward volatilities  and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor  stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model     chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6   simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options   in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities  a trinomial tree scheme is  developed   this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options     chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve   the approach  results in a multi  factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves   the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form   closed  form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options  and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options   the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options     chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions    in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time   we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging    illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models   the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi  factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed     chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk  var   applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products   after  discussing the concept of the measure  we look at how the key inputs   volatilities  covariances  correlations  etc  can be estimated   we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var  delta  delta  gamma   historical simulation and monte  carlo simulation  applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options   in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables     finally  in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk   we  look in detail at two quite different approaches  creditmetrics  j  p  morgan   1997   and creditrisk   credit suisse financial products  1997   for which  detailed information is publicly available   together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk   we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives     before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the   tool   and the market works   the techniques we describe are  certainly not   magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions   to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document     no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk   8   however   the right tools  correctly used make the job a lot easier ,0

 the lure of the san  network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today  s focus  the lure of the san  03  14  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e  business is changing how businesses value information  information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals  companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers  in this media  saturated era   information itself is packaged and sold as a product  this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial   companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations  with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months  it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information  they  often look to storage  area networks  san  as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models   today  most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i  o requests from end users and other  application servers  in this model  all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks  and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus   this model has several shortcomings  first  the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus  which limits the capacity of a single file server  second  because  the server processes each i  o request  it risks becoming a bottleneck   third  this server model carries some daunting availability limitations   because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks  if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails  then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files   this model carries other major disadvantages  distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl  finally  this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective  file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise  so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs  and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array  they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage   sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers  largely through consolidation of control  these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability  faster performance   centralized management  and by their architecture  the capability to  remove bandwidth  intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan  this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back  up operations   using high  speed transports like fibre channel  sans offer a high   performance network optimized for moving storage data  sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan  free backup  and  because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers  san devices  can be widely distributed  but also centrally managed as one network   yet  as was the case with lans in their younger years  sans are still  developing  vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues  while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together  ultimately the hope is that  like lans  sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs   given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment  the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business   to contact amy larsen decarlo

 help on dpc lng options  jeff   i fully support sandeep  s request to move anshuman srivastav to houston   i anticipate that we shall be working on dhabol related issues for the next  two years  until all the business problems are successfully resolved   anshuman is a very capable employee  with the right combination of skills to  attack the dhabol modeling challenge  he understands the indian markets as  well  as international fuel markets  he has also a very good grasp  of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the dhabol power  plant   vince                        forwarded by vince j kaminski  hou  ect on 03  12  2001  04  54 pm                             sandeep kohli  enron  development  03  12  2001 12  40 pm  to  vince j kaminski  ect  cc   subject  help on dpc lng options  vince   this is a follow  up of our meeting with jeff shankman on friday  as well as  our discussions with the global assets group on dpc issues   as you see  there is a need for developing a comprehensive fuel strategy for  dpc that encompasses both the lng phase  and the naphtha side  furthermore   any fuel strategy we develop will have to be in consonance with the power  side of the business  there is a lot of analytical work that will be  required in this context over the next several months  and we will need a  person who understands both the power and the fuel side of the business at  dpc   i believe anshuman is just such a person  he has worked closely with me over  the last 2 yrs   and has been trained in the derivatives side of the business   he has attended all three levels of derivatives classes offered at enron    over the last month  his presence in houston has greatly helped me in melding  the henwood study with the picture on the lng  fuel side  i believe his  presence in houston will be critical to us developing a comprehensive  fuel  lng strategy for dabhol  together with the global markets and asset  groups   i am therefore requesting you to explore the possibility of anshuman being  moved on a more permanent basis to houston  as you are aware  anshuman  himself would welcome such an arrangement   regards   sandeep ,0
 re  insead high  tech acquisitions workshop  ben  thanks for attending  i was on  vacation  last week  driving from ca to  houston   and could not answer your first message regardoing insead conference in time   the objective was to find out more about the he workshop on high  tech  acquisitions  and evaluate the usefulness of the program for enron  i shall be making a  recommendation  to jeff skilling that we should work with wharton as a partner in a number of  different research projects   i shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation  of small high  tech firms   vince  benjamin parsons  06  12  2000 05  50 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc  bryan seyfried  lon  ect  ect  subject  insead high  tech acquisitions workshop  vince  i attended the workshop on high  tech acquisitions at insead on saturday  alongside participants from cisco  eads  razorfish and cable  wireless  and  academics from insead and wharton  the basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the research project  and a phd study which  is currently underway at wharton  the discussions were very interesting   especially as this was my first exposure to this area   examples of the discussions raised include  why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in  house  what degree of post  acquisition integration was optimal  difficulties of us firms acquiring euro  asian high  tech companies  how to value small high  tech firms  how to quantify the success  failure of an acquisition  my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first  hand access to the results  plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others  through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies  i guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high  tech  communication industry to be seen in such  studies   regards  ben,0

but match  still possible  negotiated el paso deal topped  el paso confirmed that someone had upped the ante on the negotiated deal  for slightly  more than 1  2 bcf  d in firm capacity to the california border that was  announced friday   see daily gpi  dec  13   a higher bid was submitted prior to  wednesday  s 1 p  m  mst  deadline in a four  day open season  a pipeline spokesman said  however   the original  negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and  retain the capacity   the new bid was for  38 million over one year starting jan  1  about  8  million more than  the amount in friday  s announcement   30 million   one source called it   ridiculous  that  someone was willing to pay so much for the space  given that on a  mark  to  market basis  the capacity is worth only about  20  25 million   late last week some sources speculated that duke energy was the  recipient of next  year  s package given its large power generation holdings in california   a marketer  yesterday said he believed dynegy upped the ante   rather than go  through all the  hassles they  dynegy  had at ferc with the 1998  99 package  they let  someone else do  all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid  that way  no one can  complain that the procedure was tainted  after all  dynegy has quite a  few power plants  in california to keep fueled  and all of their current ft on el paso  expires at the end of  this year  of course  they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer  matches their bid  it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of  makes sense   other  sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high  bidder  pointing out  that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  san  juan  border basis differentials narrowed significantly  a dynegy source  indicated that the  company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round   regardless of what happens next year  a marketer noted that the southern  california  border  san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas  withdraws from  storage and east  of  california utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold  weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west  from a december index  spread of 29  cents  the border  basin gap was down to about 18 cents

 re  choosing the riskfree rate  dear all   i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable  benchmarks  i also think that fmas have their own advantages and  disadvantages   however  it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor  as benchmark  at least to price anything related to capital markets  for  example  credit default swaps   our prices will always be different from  that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market   as a half  way solution we can have different benchmarks  for example  use  anything  that we decide is closest to risk  free  to value products  significantly different from that priced on capital markets  and libor for  everything priced on capital markets   we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients  event  liquidity   recovery  for our purposes  but it looks like benchmark should be libor   to avoid negative default probabilites  for highly rated reference entities   we can add cost fo repo and haircuts  as all bankers do    let us continue our discussion on this   slava  benjamin parsons  13  03  2000 20  07  to  bryan seyfried  lon  ect  ect  martin mcdermott  lon  ect  ect  viacheslav  danilov  lon  ect  ect  stuart ffoulkes  lon  ect  ect  eklavya sareen  lon  ect  ect   tomas valnek  lon  ect  ect  john metzler  lon  ect  ect  simon brooks  lon  ect  ect   konstantin malinovski  lon  ect  ect  cc  vasant shanbhogue  hou  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  steven  leppard  lon  ect  ect  jitendra patel  lon  ect  ect  william s  bradford  hou  ect  ect  harry arora  hou  ect  ect  subject  choosing the riskfree rate  dear all   following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago   regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree  curve  i  ve written the attached short document  my preliminary conclusions  are as follows   recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30  year bonds   treasuries are still the most liquid curve  and that used by banks for  benchmarking risky debt   there is a considerable a liquidity  scarcity premium inherent within the  corporate  treasury spread  which we are not taking into account  more  accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy  prices based on treasuries  which are consistent with the market   all further comments are welcome of course   regards  ben,0

phone number is  617  492  9551   i graduated from princeton university in 1996  mathematics   and came  straight to mit for a  ph  d  in operations management at the sloan schoolof management  in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics   optimization  stochastic processes  etc   as well as a number of courses in  psychology  at mit and harvard   i am working with prof  gabriel bitran   and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations  in  particular  i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies  hence the interest in psychology   the  tentative  title of my  phd thesis is  pricing substitute products on the internet   and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about   thanks again  and i  m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week   paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective   to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet   motivation   this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet  related businesses  the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices   furthermore   companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to   the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies  consumers usually search for generic products  e  g   vcrs  or computers  without knowing exactly what they will buy  companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer  this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about   the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet  the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings  such as pricing services  services are unique  and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company  our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services   research strategy   our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies  these  components are choice models and optimization models   choice models   choice models describe how customers make choices  the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models  psychology and economics  the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods  these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains   these methods tend to be very context  specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis  economists focus on utility  maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models   the most common economic model of choice is the logit model  the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet  the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet   optimization   traditionally  the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon  on the internet  the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists  but there is also a need to learn about customers  short term  profit is based on sales  but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them  the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component  sales  and a long term component   learning  ,0

who should write the preface for the book  and   you  kindly offered that you would provide this  is this still  possible  we  realise that you are extremely busy  so chris and les went  ahead and wrote  something  which is below  and if you want to review  change or  re  write the  preface  that would be very appreciated  let me know  what your thoughts  are   thanks   julie   we  re getting close   preface  one of our main objectives in  writing energy derivatives  pricing and risk  management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches  for the  pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible  to discuss  in  depth  the models  and to show how  they relate to each other  in this  way we hope  to  help the reader to analyse the different models  price a wide  range of  energy  derivatives  or to build a risk management system which uses a  consistent  modelling framework  we  believe that for practitioners this last point is  very  important and we continue  to stress in our articles and presentations the  dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving arbitrage opportunities  to  your competitors by using  ad  hoc and inconsistent models for different  instruments and markets  see also others who propose consistent  models     however  it is not  our wish to concentrate on one particular model or  models   at the exclusion of  the others because we believe that the choice should  rest  with the user   although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model  s  we  prefer   we therefore try and give  as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the  models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which  best suit their needs   in order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters   in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to   model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book  in  addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the black  scholes  modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for  derivative pricing  which are used throughout the  book   in chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices  as  well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that  can  be used to model the prices   we look at the well  know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as  mean reversion  stochastic volatility and jump  processes  discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated   chapter 3  written by vince  kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp   discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets   this  chapter builds on the previous one  it examines in detail the methods    merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing  models introduced in chapter 2   examples from crude  gas  and electricity  markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility   chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets  although  such  curves  are well understood and straight  forward in the most financial  markets  the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined  curves   in this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward  curves from market instruments  we  outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward  curves in energy  markets  the arbitrage approach  the econometric approach  and  deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors   chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses  examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps  caps  floors and collars  as well as  energy  swaptions  compound options  asian options  barrier options  lookback  options   and ladder options   chapter 6 investigates single and  multi  factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives  closed form  solutions  for forward prices  forward volatilities  and european option prices  both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in  this  chapter including a three factor  stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model   chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in  chapter 6  simulation schemes are  developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety  of  path  dependent options  in order  to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities  a trinomial  tree scheme is developed  this tree  is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to  price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options   chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed  forward curve  the approach results  in a  multi  factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves   the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general  form  closed  form solutions are  developed  for  pricing standard european options  and efficient monte carlo  schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options  the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options   chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions    in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem   of  managing the risk through time   we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging   illustrating  the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models  the general  model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi  factor hedging of a   portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed   chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of value at risk  var   applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products  after   discussing  the concept of the measure  we look at how the key inputs   volatilities   covariances  correlations  etc  can be estimated  we then compare the fours  major  methodologies for computing var  delta  delta  gamma  historical  simulation and  monte  carlo simulation  applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy  options  in this chapter we also  look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market  variables   finally  in chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk   we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches  creditmetrics  j  p  morgan   1997    and  creditrisk   credit suisse financial  products  1997   for which  detailed  information is publicly available  together these provide an extensive set   of  tools with which to measure credit risk  we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives   before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the  tool   and the market works  the  techniques we describe are certainly  not   magic wands  which can be waved at  data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions  to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document   no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk     however  the right tools   correctly  used make the job a lot  easier ,0
 re  eol pricing algorithm  hi bob   some comments   1  you request enron position after successful market order  but not after limit order   you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent  i am not clear on how you would use enron position  it is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position  but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere  and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron position to  of course  enron position may still provide some insights   2  you request bid  mid  ask prices for each trade    given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order  especially for limit orders   would you need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over this time interval  time of order to time of execution   also  for failed trades  you may need the evolution or range of bid  mid  ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection  this again mainly applies to limit orders  as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution  something to check         original message       from  lee  bob  sent  monday  april 23  2001 8  33 am  to  kaminski  vince  shanbhogue  vasant  barkley  tom  cc  lu  zimin  huang  alex  gibner  stinson  subject  eol pricing algorithm  a draft data request for eol data we would use to study p  l patterns for the  george  pricing algorithm is attached for your review   i would like to send this to andy zipper and jay webb this afternoon   bob  ,0

 cera monthly oil briefing  cera alert  december 20  2000  title  cera monthly oil briefing  fundamentals update  e  mail category  cera monthly briefing  cera knowledge area  world oil  in the past two weeks  oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength  that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages  this winter  the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard  to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil  stock situation is at least stabilizing  even if stocks have not built  substantially  and that  thus far  despite a few weeks of colder  than  normal  temperatures  heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key  us market  that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving  speculative interest into the market  furthermore  the potential for weakness  in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001   the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that  iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide  yet  the iraqi export  cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals  if the cutoff lasts  through december  the effect will be pronounced  it would turn a projected  fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0  5 million barrels per day  mbd  into a  stockdraw of 0  1 mbd  we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic  because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions  and  exports may again cease  at some point such a development would have a price  supportive effect   cera  s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch  released in late november  assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or  repeated shutdowns of iraqi production  the projected average for first  quarter 2001 is  29 per barrel for wti  however  this outlook is based on  opec  s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its  production by the start of the second quarter  a failure to restrain output  would result in a downward adjustment to an average of  27 wti for the first  quarter of 2001  with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in  the first  the downward pressure results from the prospect of a  larger  than  usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about  3  0 mbd  with a cut in opec output   iraq in a twilight zone  as anticipated  iraq ceased exporting oil under the un  controlled  oil for  food  program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security  council  s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule    iraq  s pricing was judged by the un overseers  who monitor the export program  and advise the sanctions committee  to be about 60 cents per barrel below  comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that  iraq was seeking from buyers   although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues  iraq partially  resumed exporting on december 13  since then  about 1 mbd has been exported  from the mina al  bakr terminal in the persian gulf  prior to the shutdown   iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2  21 mbd for november  as  compared with 2  08 mbd for the third quarter  exports for november were about  1  3 mbd from mina al  bakr and about 0  9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean   exports from ceyhan have not resumed  owing to the surcharge dispute  with  the result that about 1  2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market   iraq  s semi  shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its  dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues   in the midst of  this dispute  the un security council approved phase nine of the oil  for  food  program at the last minute on december 5  it became effective on december 6  and has been accepted by iraq   as of decemberl 9  iraq  s revised export price  for ceyhan  proposed for the remainder of december  has again been judged too  low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions  committee  additionally  the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude  that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow  account would be a violation of un sanctions  buyers of iraqi oil from mina  al  bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a  surcharge to iraq   how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear  but it continues  to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an  apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are  the heart of the sanctions system  the distinction that iraq has made between  mina al  bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al  bakr by  loading two cargoes for the india oil company  iraq may have judged this  accommodation to be in its interest  since it recently also signed an oil  exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil  as  currently structured  the deal would violate un sanctions  but india is  seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic  hardship  the exception seems unlikely to be granted  which may lead iraq to  cease exports from mina al  bakr again   there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow  but we expect  uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as  leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security  council to end all restraints  consequently  the iraq factor will remain an  element in the oil price outlook   iraq  s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq  issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take  office  secretary of state  designate colin powell has already acknowledged a  need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to  reenergize   sanctions  the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign  policy  oriented think tank in washington  a consensus seems to be emerging  around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by  retaining un control over iraq  s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a  prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general  trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international  irritant  there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to  destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that  the prospects for success are remote   demand trends  record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for  gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so   and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas  interruptible gas  customers with resid or distillate fuel back  up have already switched to oil   so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the  already high level of distillate demand  so far in december us distillate  demand is running at a record high december level of 3  9 mbd  however  only a  small portion of this demand is the result of economically based  fuel  switching from gas to distillate  cera estimates that the additional  demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is  relatively small  on the order of 0  1 to 0  2 mbd  in cera  s view it is likely  that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short  notice because in some cases  this theoretically switchable capacity has not  been used in recent years  and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in  uncertain condition   switching by interruptible gas customers  such as utilities  to distillate  began about a month or more ago  although the volumes involved are relatively  small  switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices  started to surge in the summer  a portion of the us secondary and tertiary  distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible  gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage  given the  expectations of a tight gas market  regulators have been explicit about  enforcing back  up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the  current heating season   other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching   some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost  of feedstock natural gas is high  natural gas is also used in some enhanced  oil recovery operations  and some of these producers have also opted to sell  gas back to the grid rather than produce oil   supply trends  non  opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0  9 mbd over a  year earlier at 46  4 mbd  recent events include a shortfall in mexican  production  curtailed in october by about 300  000 bd owing to the effects of  hurricane keith  mexico  s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be  3  64 mbd  about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity  norway  s output  increased 200  000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended   norway  s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3  53 mbd    growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a  recent surge in exports  in spite of higher export taxes  russian exports of  domestic oil production  excluding transit volumes  reached 2  5 mbd in  november  after remaining fairly steady at about 2  35 mbd from july though  october  fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2  5 mbd  0  3 mbd  greater than in the fourth quarter 1999   cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2  91 mbd in november  down 0  1  mbd from the october level  the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced  iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0  8 mbd  iraq  resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13  which raised production to  1  80 mbd  assuming no change in iraq  s current production stance  iraqi  production would average 1  41 mbd for december  on a quarterly basis  the  decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth  quarter of 29  0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0  5  mbd into a stockdraw of 0  1 mbd  these production estimates include 0  15 mbd  of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un  authorization and are continuing   oil stocks  us crude oil inventories  doe data  have climbed intermittently from an  annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million  barrels in mid  december  see figure 1   since prices weakened in late  november  crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september  and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289  292 million barrels   primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year  earlier levels   at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels  or 24 percent less  than  those of a year ago  but there are indications of builds in secondary and  tertiary inventories  we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up  5  10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at  the end of last year   in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with  those of the united states  in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels  to 426 million barrels  at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but  well above the low levels of early 1996  see figure 2   japanese crude oil  inventories at end  october were 107  6 million barrels  which is above the  record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent  years  see figure 3    come shoot the rapids

focused on  for the california electricity crisis  state officials around governor gray  davis have  toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed  they would be in the market as early as tuesday taking bids for energy to be  paid by the  state of california  one problem on that front is still how much producers  want to charge the state for electricity  as we reported last week  davis and  his aides  want to pay around  50 to  55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want  about  75  treasury secretary summers has suggested an auction as the best  way to  determine the price  but california officials are taking a less free market  approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long  term  contracts   our sources in washington  sacramento  and california are increasingly of the  view that governor davis is positioning his government to establish long  term  power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the  utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term  this week  s legislative  activities  in sacramento will create the vehicle to do so  state credit backing  purchases of power would obviate the need for super  priority borrowing to  finance power  purchases after utility bankruptcy   1  audit  untangling utility relationships  california officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment  front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that  half of the  9 to  12 billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to  themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations  this strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both  the power  generating and power  distributing companies under a  holding company umbrella  of course  that means that some of the power pg  e  and southern california edison bought at highly inflated prices  was bought from themselves   but it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations  sources confirm that  davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part  of any  potential solution  he told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to  use state credit to eliminate the  risky debt  premium that pg  e  and sce are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and  that he is willing to extend the current 10  rate increase  utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90  day deadline  in  return he is demanding that the companies prepare to  share the  burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension    2  debt restructuring  guarantees  but no direct state money  davis also told the videoconference that he believes the  12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up  during a 90  day forbearance period  whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now   davis  idea  as  he laid it out in the meeting  is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities  forward rate base or by  establishing a  medium  term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees   in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to  paydown their debt  one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the   50   55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay  down this debt  there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations  but he remains  opposed to using direct state money  this frustrates both clinton  administration and utility creditors  but davis has not yet shown much  flexibility   3  eminent domain  reregulation  perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury  and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political  advisers have with  non  market  solutions to the energy crisis  although  the governor  s aides actually believe the weapon is more a  way to force  eventual  agreement  than an actual solution   the talk returns frequently to these  non  market mechanisms   we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the  tuesday deadline  if we make no progress  if this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis  then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re  take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves   a close political aide to  davis said   we will absorb the plants  the transmission lines and the  reserved parking  places of the executives  the legislature would agree in a second  ,0

 jacob feedback  vince   chonawee and tom halliburton had feedback about jacob to me   tom  s feedback is what he does for pros is actually too simple  their so  called  trading system is actually a scheduling system   my impression is that jacob is good at selling himself  his knowledge  of finance and derivatives is very limited   zimin                        forwarded by zimin lu  hou  ect on 04  11  2001 03  31 pm                             chonawee supatgiat  enron  03  21  2001 07  28 pm  to  zimin lu  hou  ect  ect  cc  tom halliburton  corp  enron  enron  subject  jacob feedback  i asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge  he answered correctly in the optimization question so i believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill  i have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models  if we had more interview time i would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills   he completely failed to answer the second question  which is to check his basic risk management skill  it is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management  he does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk  he showed some weakness in annuity calculation   in conclusion  i feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance  based on his experiences  i have a doubt on his advance optimization skills  such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem  i would recommend a second  round interview if he will be solving a complex  optimization problem    chonawee,0

 california update 5  4  01  if you have any questions  please contact kristin walsh at  713  853  9510   bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance  bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline  any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources  both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic caucus is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis  many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that  once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund  davis would  double dip  into the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor  however  it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated  a bond issuance will take place  additionally  some generator sources have reported that some of the long  term power contracts  as opposed to those still in development  require that the bond issuance happen by july 1  2001  if not  the state may be in breach of contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th  having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult   the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the  5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  8 billion  however  the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor  s plan for handling the crisis  including the details and terms of all long  term contracts he has negotiated  before they will support the bond issuance to go forward   currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan  ab 8 x and ab 31 x  ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to  10 billion in bonds  this bill passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support  ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts  however  sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen  currently in ab 8 x  senator bowen  s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy    according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund  for instance  tony strickland has stated that only 1  2 of the bonds  or approximately  5 billion  should be issued  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds  the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday  additionally  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan   key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount   4  125 b  lenders  jp morgan  2  5 b  lehman brothers  1  0 b  bear stearns  625 m  tax exempt portion  of the  4  125 b   1  6 b is expected to be tax  exempt  projected interest rate  taxable rate 5  77   tax  exempt rate 4  77   current projected  blended ir  5  38   maturity date  august 29  2001  for more details please contact me at  713  853  9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday  which authorizes  5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority  the  5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the  5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased  or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward  again  the republicans are not in support of these authorizations  without the details of the long  term power contracts the governor has negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support  no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power  also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for the california public power and conservation authority  however  this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis   socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier  according to sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has signed it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy  or its creditor  involuntary  due to the lack operating cash   the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond issuance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x  bridge loan  stating that the dwr would received 100  of its payments from ratepayers  then the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words  the state will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and passed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments ,0

 re  working gas price model  vince   i have a simplified version of brad  s model in mind   the  no arbitrage  condition equates trading margins across the country   costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network  wellhead supply is  almost completely price  elastic  while burner  tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic  storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option   the least time  variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline  followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline  the intermediate  variant parameters are  the capacity  dependent costs paid to the pipeline  above shrinkage  for  transmission  the most time  variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option   there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork   they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways  using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above  or point  estimates   calibrations   using only today  s data  based on a node  based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination  albeit markedly different terminus  price  versus capacity similarly   competing  for outflows   i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience   clayton,0

 friday brown bag on derivative pricing  dear everyone   we understand the as members of enron research group  all of us are working  on very interesting projects  some of which are ground  breaking  and we all  keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology  we also find  out  through our own experience  that at this age of information explosion   it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep  abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department  let  alone in the industry  it is also our personal experience that many a  project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of  this group   as a remedy  we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag  lunch group meeting  once every two weeks on friday  for about 50 minutes   it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new  technology and development  as well as with each other   s work  so that we do  not have to reinvent the wheels   we envision the following  in this meeting  or seminar   each one of us will  take turns to make presentations to the group  the topics could range from  theoretical consideration to practical implementation  be it option pricing   process modelling  insurance issue  or monte carlo simulation  or anything  one finds fascinating  the presentation material could be papers you have  been reading recently  projects you are working on  some problem that  bothers you  or an idea that is fascinating  you choose your own  presentation style  it could be  everything  you  always  wanted  to  know  but  were  afraid  to  ask  hand waving  style  or it can involve nitty  gritty  detailed derivations  anyway a style  that suits you and the topic  or it can simply be a dry  run for your  presentation at the next risk conference  zimin and alex will take upon the  responsibility of organizing the seminar   we hope the seminar will be up and running in two  three weeks  for that  purpose your support will be greatly appreciated  please let either zimin or  alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and  provide a tentative schedule  surely the rest of the group will be happy to  hear your presentation   we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting  either to give a  talk or just sit in   zimin lu  alex huang,0

 commercialization of nasa technology  hey  i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin  off of the caltech  nasa jet propulsion laboratory  jpl  to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises  viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world  viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets  viaspace target markets are in excess of  100 b  yr and growing with a cagr of over 20   in the past six years viaspace has created three companies  spectrasensors  qwip technologies and vialogy corp  their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology   spectrasensors  com  qwip  com  vialogy  com   the company  s current focus is on three subsidiaries  direct methanol fuel cell  arroyo sciences and ionfinity   direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation  dmfcc  will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow  s fuel cell  powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones  methanol fuel cells  dfmc  are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices  a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs  2 to  3  a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks  we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating  as a disposable product  it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc   the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents  toshiba  nec  sanyo  and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology  dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers   arroyo sciences  inc   arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency  nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation  supply chain  security  logistics assurance and first responder safety markets  the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments  this product combines radio frequency identification  rfid  tags  wireless digital communications  ground positioning satellite  gps   data for 2  d and 3  d geolocation determination  geographic information system  gis  and sensor technologies  real  time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger  applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations  improved coordination of multi  agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments   the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports  power plants  airports  and telecommunication facilities  real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe   deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x  ray and gamma ray imaging  arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo   ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry  ms  technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms  with a 10 times increase in mass range  higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological  chemical and nuclear contaminants  the current market for ms is estimated at  1  2 billion annually  the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market  new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband  epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up   additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are  1  a water purification technology and  2  interactive radio  the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish  sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra  pure water  the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance  the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast  the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus   forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by  1  increasing wireless usage of computing devices and  2  the existing need to extend cell phone battery life  we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to  195 million by 2009  homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences  which will begin to generate revenues in 2005  and will grow to  90 million in 2009  we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007  and will be  10 million in 2009  beyond 2009  total revenues will grow at a 60  to 80  rate for several years from existing and new products  contracting with existing manufacturers  we expect operating margins will be in the low 40  range by 2009  our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from  8  40 to  11  10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe  the graph below outlines our

accounting  standards board  fasb    fasb 133  fasb is considering an exception to statement of financial accounting  standards  sfas  no  133 that will exempt energy companies from the  requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives  a vote against  the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility   and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers   attached is a  summary of this issue   the board is expected to vote on this issue during  may 2001  eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns  if  you  or company cfo would like more information about this effort  please  contact richard mcmahon  executive director of the alliance of energy  suppliers  at rmcmahon  eei  org  or at 202  508  5571   alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25   2001  inside washington  federal affairs     bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee     the senate banking committee today approved s 206  a bill that repeals the  public utility holding company act of 1935  the bill would repeal puhca and  transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities  and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and  appropriate state agencies   s  206 was approved with two amendments  offered by sen  mike enzi  r  wy    the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition  task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for  electric energy in the united states  the task force would be made up of  representatives of ferc  the department of justice and the federal trade  commission  as well as non  voting representatives from the department of  agriculture and the securities and exchange commission  the amendment also  contained a provision  co  sponsored by sen  paul sarbanes  d  md   that would  preserve ferc  s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do  not include the pass  through of holding company costs that are unrelated to  energy   another amendment  offered by sen  jon corzine  d  nj   initiated a study by  the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments  in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies  and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets      institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill     the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association   appa  and the large public power council  lppc  again has been introduced in  the house  the bill  hr 1459  contains the same provisions as were in a  measure  hr 4971   with technical corrections  introduced during the 106 th  congress  hr 1459 was introduced by rep  j  d  hayworth  r  az  and nine  original co  sponsors from the ways and means committee   hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes  1  the tax  free  sale or spin  off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed  2  nuclear  decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing  deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost  of service ratemaking   3  the contributions in aid of construction  ciac  tax on interconnections to  transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated  and 4  private use  tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution  facilities   the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee  and eei has  urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward  enactment will  help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment  the institute  noted  the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389  senate energy  committee chairman frank murkowski  s  r  ak  energy security bill  and  stand  alone legislation could also be introduced  hearings are expected to  be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees   probably after consideration of president bush  s individual tax proposal   administration  ferc     white house seeks  2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002     president bush last week transmitted a  2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget  request to capitol hill  the administration noted that its proposal   moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent  in 2002   an increase of  26 billion over the preceding fiscal year  the  budget bid contains a  231 billion total surplus in 2002  and projects a  5  6  trillion surplus over the next ten years   in the energy area  the administration noted the federal government   s   longstanding and evolving role  in the sector  pointing out that most  federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts   it proposed about  2  8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs   and about  2  1 billion in tax benefits   mainly to encourage development of  traditional and alternative energy sources   doe   s budget request was  19  2  billion  including  2  3 billion for energy resources programs  this later  figure represents a decrease of  196 million  or 7  9 percent  from fiscal  year 2001   in the environmental sector  the administration sought some  7  3 billion in  discretionary funding for epa  including a  3  7 billion operating program  focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws      success of restructuring tied to energy strategy  ferc   s massey asserts     electric restructuring may be in jeopardy  and its success  is in the hands  of regulators and policymakers   ferc commissioner william massey has  asserted  speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum  in philadelphia  commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the  key elements of a national energy strategy   first  he specified  there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy  commodity  turning to a second element  commissioner massey told forum  attendees that  all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be  delivered over an adequate  efficient  non  discriminatory network    commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential  element of a national energy strategy  while citing an inherent difficulty   that  good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail  jurisdictions   accordingly  he said  ferc and the states must work together  on market structure   the final element of a successful energy strategy  the commissioner  specified  is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to  do their job   if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator  to ensure reasonable prices for consumers   he cautioned  they  will surely  think twice before heading down the restructuring path    new generation     dynegy to build second plant in kentucky     dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to  the riverside generating project in lawrence county  kentucky  dynegy will  sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market  commercial  operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002      ppl to expand generation capacity     ppl

 california update 3  06  01  executive summary   if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th  chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day  opt  out  clause in all long  term power contracts    pg  e and state locked in tough negotiations  several issues on the table   puc  imposed requirement forcing pg state  2  3 times book value vs  pg  e  4 times book value   pg  e will not use any of the  1 b secured last week to help their ailing  utility    davis  s announcement of long term power contract didn  t include some  details   of the 8  800 megawatts secured this far  only 6  000 are available this  summer  some of the  long term contracts  are really only for three months  none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot  market   one the same day davis announced long term contracts  davis also quietly  announce a 10  rate hike    ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal   pg  e  transmissions deal  one thing that is still uncertain is pg  e  bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy pg  e  s share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9  when all long  term power  contracts being negotiated have a one  day  opt  out  clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a  comprehensive solution  has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities   according to sources close to senior pg  e  officials  pg  e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the california government  s willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now   pg  e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to  relieve it of the puc  imposed requirement to be the  electricity buyer of  last resort   current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply california  s energy needs  as long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases  as it has for the past three months  the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings   but  pg  e officials are worried 1  this summer  s supply and 2  davis  s  concern over how fast he is draining the state  s budget surplus  if things  get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long  term contracts  then  pg  e will be left holding the bag   thus  as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid  pg  e is  demanding a  comprehensive solution  that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay  state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of  get out of  jail free  card  so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors   1  pg  2  state legislative  demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and  3  the ferc must   positively approve  any grid purchase by the state of california   the principal concern on the price front is that pg  e wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission  while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit   we see 2  3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound  there is no way pg  e will get more than that  whatever they  think   according to the leader of one main consumer groups   we are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2  0 in any case   negotiators for  davis are also trying to  proposition  proof  any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal  they think there are ways to do that  but  not if the price of pg  e  s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative   remember  if davis  s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative  he will  be running for re  election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution   on the sacramento front  no one understands pg  e  s motives  the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  pg  e is playing  in a three day period pg  e made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads    late thursday  pg  e officials leaked information to california papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state  which seemed like obvious good news  but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30   above what the state was currently offering  while a deal can still be done   anything like the  10 billion pg  e wants would be very hard to get through  the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase    late friday  pg  e officials announced that they had secured a  1 billion  loan for the parent company  not the electricity utility  and would use the  money to pay off bondholders  other creditors and to return  161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout  not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg  e and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood    over the weekend  pg  e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers  debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now  for  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will   make them whole  in a couple of months  that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving   thus  in a very short time period  pg  e  s corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis  davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the  13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and pg  e  s fund  raising will harden and deepen those demands  as one senior  political official told our source  just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible  they  come up with something even more outrageous    pg and some of these  long  term contracts  are actually only good  for three months  none of these contracts  however  keep california from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market   davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year  while the media was concern with davis  s announcement of long term contracts  for california  of less concern to the media was davis  s quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers  the state will  accept the 10  emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10  increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires   that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour   ferc  the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal  energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote  senior california officials and legislators doubt that  ferc has jurisdiction  and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal  but  they may be wrong   the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs  off on the deal  its power over transmission deal is absolute  no matter what  anyone says   according to source close to the president  there are three  possibilities  1  ferc could  pocket veto  it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion  2  the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down  the democrat on the commission  william massey  has already said he is  opposed to it  or 3  the commission could approve it but with condition that  davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system   one complicating factor in the ferc decision  however  is that its chairman  curt hebert  who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale  may not  be around long enough to have his say   hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the ferc chairman position   says one washington official  two other  appointments to the commission will soon be named  this official notes  and  one of them  could easily become chairman  ,0

 re  real options presentation  thanks for the comments grant  the presentation is for a couple of external  conferences that vince volunteered me for  vince has ok  d the content  and  stinson raised exactly the same issues as you  unfortunately i just don  t  seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my  article  so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options  notation   of course the discounting  risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement  sits  when questions arise i  ll take the line that while research formulates  the models using appropriate derivatives  market based valuation methods  we  work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with  various risks  and chooses these rates appropriately  the notation makes  clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals   which assists in choosing the rates   in practice i  m not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation  yet  another reason i can  t say too much about its actual use at the  conference  i  m producing various tools for deterministic hydro  optimization  gbm swing option valuation  and deterministic dp optimization  for genset dispatch which people want right now  i  m working in the  background on the kind of modelling my notation demands  people are getting  to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems  and they  ll be  more likely to listen when i start rolling out the  proper  options  based  models  my notation is currently used only in the specs i  m writing for the  tools i  m producing   i  ll be turning dale  s spreadsheet  based power plant spread model into an  american monte carlo tool  which will then be available for inclusion in  other models  i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical  work will start to bear fruit  one year after i initially proposed the  notation  with the quant it group i  m co  creating in place  i may yet see  the automated diagramming  pricing tool made real   thanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton  the use of the lingo  lp  integer package is something i  ve been presented with for the teesside  plant operation optimizer  rather than something i chose  the perm  physical  energy risk mgt  group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together   including natasha danilochkina   then asked me to tidy it up when it didn  t  work  they are going to use their existing faulty model for now  to meet  their project deadlines   and i  m sketching out a proper mathematical spec  for the problem   i  ve persuaded    them that this sort of business  critical system should be  developed properly by research  and they now seem happy to fall into line   their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz  the guy i  hoped to recruit into research  and they obviously didn  t realise he was  better than average at quantitative modelling  anyway they now accept that  doing it properly will take months rather than weeks  and i  ll have a freer  hand in my choice of modelling tool  so a chat with tom would be extremely  valuable   cheers   steve  enron capital is  this an internal enron or external presentation  if external  i would say it  is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff  perhaps that  s  why you  ve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and  risk  neutrality or lack of it   regards   grant ,0

the monthly   special feature  article  as in three attached examples   3  for  10  000  yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months   poten explains that 85  of their subscribers take the premium service  no  one has ever asked for the  10  000  yr long  term price forecast  i have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation   the example copies attached include the following special feature articles   99 feb  analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean  99 sep  patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere  99 dec  analysis of the resid market in chile  one either takes all or none of them for the incremental  1100  yr  some may  be useless  others perhaps quite valuable

standard 12 month  price forecasts  the cost is  3800  yr   as an added service for a total of  10  000  yr  poten will include a quarterly  update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief  justification for their view  this would include the standard monthly price  forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24  months for far east  med and nwe   i expect a more descriptive email from  poten  but i think this is the essence of their  custom  offer    the example copies attached include the following special features   99 feb  analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean  99 sep  patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere  99 dec  analysis of the resid market in chile  these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects  related to fuel oil   i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price  forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself  regarding the utility of such a report  the best way to show your  recommendation is with money  if it is not worth any money to anyone else in  ene  then i have to question its validity

 seismic data via satellite  i have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior  to a possible meeting with them   please give me any comments on 1  accuracy 2  completeness and 3  coverage  of the areas we want to explore   as a side note  i found some info on the web stating current proven oil  reserves are 1  000 billion bbls  discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would  add only 0  1   while we will pursue the trading advantage option  it is not  looking promising that it has great short term value  given the long time  frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market   bob lee,0

 mg metals  quant analysis  risk  hi eric   thanks for getting back to me  i believe there are a number of issues to  address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management  and quantitative analysis perspective  and i have put together a  by no means  exhaustive  list    i  seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective  e  g  their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add  ins   ii  development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our var system  we will require historical data  for this    iii  ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  these tasks will involve a significant degree of cross  communication with  relevant contacts within mg metals  and so i look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible  i hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development  so please do not hesitate to  involve me   best regards   anjam ahmad  research  x 35383  enron europe  from  anjam ahmad 15  06  2000 16  18  to  eric gadd  lon  ect  ect  cc  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  subject  quant analysis  structuring for metals business  dear eric   i understand from dale that you are co  ordinating the integration of mg  metals into enron europe  dale and i thought it would be a good idea to  ensure that we are fully prepared from a quantitative research and  structuring perspective so that we can  hit the ground running  when they do  arrive  i would be grateful if you could provide a contact person in mg  metals that may look after this area  or someone who may find it useful to  discuss and identify their possible future modelling requirements   thanks  regards   anjam ahmad  research  x 35383,0
 patricia tlapek  brad   as per our previous discussions  vince wanted me to give you the background  on our request to bring patricia tlapek into the research group at the very  top end of the manager group  the justification for this was not only her  extraordinary performance in setting up our technical analysis section but  also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope   this memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning   this past year patricia was extremely successful in building internal  clientele for her products and recommendations  she is now widely relied on  by gas  power  crude and equity marketers  as well as traders from the  calgary office  in addition  she developed and presented seminars to bring  traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis   also this last year patricia built and populates daily the research group  s  intranet site on technical analysis   as a crowning achievement  but just the beginning   patricia was given the  authority to actually trade natural gas as jeff shankman  managing director   authorized her book for technical analysis trading   currently  we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel  wise  and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade  live books on other energy commodities and energy  related equities   for these reasons  we want to peg patricia  s salary at the top of the pay  scale   thanks for expediting this effort      mike,0

 linear programming software purchase  vince   i  d like to purchase some copies of the xpress lp solver for the gas storage  optimization model  we have previously discussed the purchase of cplex  but  after trialing both systems  have found some worthwhile advantages with  xpress  if others find planner  cplex best suited to their application  i  see no problem is their use of a different system  both have strengths  and  it is likely that i would use planner  cplex myself on some future project if  we were to have both systems available   xpress is particularly suited to my application because it handles special  ordered sets  this is a very efficient way of representing the storage  ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information  provided by the set  rather than just using binary integer variables to  represent the ratchets   planner is a c   interface for cplex  it has some significant limitations   and does not permit access to all cplex features   dash optimization have made the following offer   all software purchases made by enron this year will be at 30  off the list  price  we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of  licenses to obtain this discount   90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase   the emosl utility will be provided at no cost   the xbsl system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few  weeks time   for the gas storage optimization model  i would like to purchase   one development license  hyper version  with modeller  primal  dual simplex   mip search  dlls  emosl and xbsl when available   list price  10  000 discounted price  7  000  two run time licenses for above   list price total  8  000 discounted price  5  600  total cost  12  600  i  ve used the usually security request system to set the purchase process  going  should you agree to this   tom ,0

 the storage revolution has begun  network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today  s focus  the storage revolution has begun  03  07  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  the storage revolution has  begun  by amy larsen decarlo  believe the hype  we are in the middle of a storage revolution   virtually overnight  businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to  terabytes of data  and the number of users accessing that information is  skyrocketing  the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to  rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of  storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery   it isn   t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that  are changing how businesses handle storage  the premium that companies  place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound  effect on their storage requirements  businesses demand fault  tolerant  storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their  employees  suppliers and customers   but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements  on average   double every 12 months  while processor speeds double every 18 months   companies are left with a quandary  how can they manage the  proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for  the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds   the simple answer to this question is to institute a well  executed  storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in  advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support  those needs  bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not  from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those  systems   there are several ways to efficiently manage storage  one of the best  routes is consolidation that is  pooling resources and managing  storage as a system  as opposed to a decentralized collection of file  servers  this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era  when  enterprise storage resided on mainframes  but it   s actually a  progressive step  as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing  the planning  management  and ongoing support of storage systems than it  does with the physical location of the files   next  it is important to recognize that not all information is equally  important to the organization  consequently  storage requirements vary  by business application  as in all areas of it  it is important to make  storage implementation decisions based on business needs   businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for  alternatives to the distributed file server storage model  they want to  speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth  intensive backup and  recovery operations from the lan   network  attached storage  nas  supplies it professionals with one  answer  giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to  stored data  nas devices  which have been widely available for years   are optimized to process i  o transactions  though they promise better  performance  they don   t remove backups from the transport network   instead  they supply a relatively easy  to  deploy solution to cross   platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments   many consider storage  area networks  san  to be the best long  term  answer to current and future storage challenges  because sans are  designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network  they  alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated  with more traditional storage models  yet  given the early deployment  stage most companies are still in  many of those capabilities are still  largely untested in a production environment   this newsletter will examine how  through effective storage management   it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery  to their customers  this newsletter will not focus on items like the  least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library  instead  it will  look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging  technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues   ultimately  the goal is to identify storage technology options and  practices that work in real  world environments   to contact amy larsen decarlo                                  amy larsen decarlo is an analyst with enterprise management associates  in boulder  colo    http    www   com   a leading

andromeda  rutgers  edu    subject  invitation to the 20 th annual rutgers conference  vince   for two decades now  i have been a member of the faculty helping to  organize the eastern conferences on regulation and competition that michael  crew of rutgers has chaired  this year will be  in fact  the 20 th  anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining  us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven  t about the  economics of network industries  fred kahn  al philipps  bill hogan and a  number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and  the prospects for the future  the conference will take place at a  beautiful site in the poconos  about 90 minutes north of philadelphia  from  wednesday afternoon may 24 th to friday afternoon may 26 th  you can check  for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site  hotel at the  following website url   http    www  rci  rutgers  edu   crri  ws  htm  michael crew and i would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an  after dinner speaker on thursday evening  may 25 th   just before the key  research reviews of friday morning take place on the electricity  telephone  and gas industries  and following a day of special topics on emerging power  markets and other developments in network industries  naturally we would  be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference  but  knowing your schedule  you may only have time for a part of it  that would  not be a problem  the usual after  dinner address is for 30 minutes   followed by a short q  a period   your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of  enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price  discovery and efficient risk management for market participants  in energy  markets and more generally  both michael and i feel that your perspectives  on the  new science of risk management  and what can be expected from it  could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event   please let me know  and please do copy michael on your response  whether  your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event   michael and i would  of course  be very happy to follow up with you in  discussing the nature of the presentation  participants and so forth  if  this is a go  i look forward to

 data for moody  s riskcalc  craig and kim   as you know  i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody  s riskcalc   you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc   well  after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today  s 2  hour moody  s presentation  it is necessary for us to have information about enron  s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc   we have obtained some information on enron  s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office   we need for you and  or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron  s north american counterparties   more specifically  to evaluate moody  s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron  s north american  private firm  counterparties   fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented  annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables  such as cost of goods sold  net income  sales  and ebit  the value should be a four  digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000  forecasts until the year 2009 can be made  a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year  s  1999  inflation level  in general this  estimation error  will not cause any great problems  as size affects default rates at very large scales  e  g    10  000  000 vs   1  000  000 makes a significant difference   1  000  000 vs   1  050  00 does not    cash  equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities   inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet  in thousands dollars  without any alterations for accounting method  e  g   lifo  fifo  average cost   this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue  specifically this would include purchase cost  sales cost  sales taxes  transportation costs  insurance costs  and storage costs   current assets  this item primarily represents cash  inventories  accounts receivables  marketable securities  and other current assets   total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars  for example   15  500  000 should be entered as 15500  specifically  total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property  plant  and equipment plus other noncurrent assets  including intangible assets  deferred items  and investments and advances   leave previous year  s total assets blank for australian companies   current liabilities  liabilities are positive values  included in current liabilities are short  term debt  accounts payable  and other current liabilities   total liabilities  this balance sheet account  total liabilities  is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long  term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities  including deferred taxes  investment tax credit  and minority interest    retained earnings  retained earnings  a historical measure of performance  is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders  typically  it is the prior year  s retained earnings plus net income less distributions  retained earnings are generally positive  some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings  leave this field blank for australian companies   sales  this item consists of the industry segment  s gross sales  the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period  reduced by cash discounts  trade discounts  and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers   cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars  this value is generally a positive number less than sales  it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production  such as material  labor  and overhead  not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  leave this field blank for australian companies   ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation  it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income   interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short  and long  term debt  typically  we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities  one measure of computing this is  interest expense  0  07  total liabilities   net income  this item represents the income  or loss  reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations  a loss is represented by a negative sign  for example  a  5  000  000 loss would be entered as  5000  leave previous year  s net income blank for australian companies   extraordinary items  positive or negative  this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement  the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations  these items include extraordinary gains  losses  income  loss  from discontinued operations  and cumulative affect of accounting changes  expenses are entered as negative values  gains as positive values  leave previous year  s extraordinary items blank for australian companies   country  this model is calibrated for the united states  canada  and australia   we look forward to receiving this information for enron  s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of riskcalc   thanks   iris,0

 re  chapter 3 revisions  grant   sorry for the silence  it  s definately not a commentary on your work  i  ve  been travelling back and forward between sydney and london like a yo  yo and  trying to tidy up things on our end  i  ve been working on incoporating your  material and will spend all of tomorrow on this  hopefully   so that i can  ask for the last few amendments before the w  end   many thanks and best regards   chris        original message       from  grant masson  to  chris strickland  sent  tuesday  june 27  2000 8  54 am  subject  re  chapter 3 revisions         chris      i can  t decide if i should take your silence over the past several weeks  to mean   that you are getting stuck into finishing up the book or you are just so   thoroughly disgusted with our work that you would like to wash your hands  of us      i  ve been stuck on trying to get the last figure mentioned in the chapter  into a   format that i like  the problem is the volatility found in the  regressions is   on the order of several hundred percent  and so when i plot the historical  data   next to a simulated curve over the course of the year  the simulated curve  tends   to drift up or down stupidly both in the jump diffusion and garch  jump  diffusion   model  any suggestions would be accepted with pleasure  i wonder if i  should   skip the figure  it seems a pity to do so however  because otherwise the  last   section comes off as a bit of an afterthought  and i would like to present  a   practical example  again any guidance would be appreciated      anyway  i am sending you a somewhat improved draft now  minus only the  last   figure   rather than sit on the whole thing while i stew on this bit  i  hope   this will be useful to you  because i am leaving for holidays at the end  of the   week  i can guarantee you that you will have a final draft before then      regards    grant     see attached file  cs 260600  doc   ,0

 california update 3  16  01   a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram  energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week  through an  intermediary  we were able to corroborate this information with a senior  member of the ca iso board  coram energy is a relatively small wind  generator qf based in west vancouver  british columbia  though it also owns  wind stations in california  coram has 238 40 kw units    the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the  fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to  be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature  it is unlikely  that blackouts would happen in april or may  meaning a long wait for the  cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid    the filing will be against socal    in order to file an involuntary bankruptcy  coram would have to file along  with at least two other creditors owed  10  000 or more  sources report coram  has two other creditors who will file with them  working on finding out who  they are     sources also report that other qfs are  taking legal advice  on how to  proceed in light of these developments ,0

 class speaker  vincent   we met last year when you were visiting the university  and talking  primarily with our finance faculty  as you may have heard  i tried to call  to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real  options from your group at enron  naturally  i would be delighted if you  could speak  but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone else  might also be a good choice   i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information   this is the first time this course has been offered at ut  and i was  motivated to do so because of the  buzz  regarding the topic in industry  i  have about 30 mba students in the class  many of whom were in the energy  finance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn  both of whom have  been very supportive of the development of this class   my own background  is decision analysis rather than finance  so i tend to approach the topic  with that perspective  as you can see  i have covered both traditional  decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature  at the  present time  i don  t think there is a really complete textbook that fits  the course at the mba level  so i  ve tried to focus on how to do things in  practice  and have provided software  dpl  spreadsheets   risk  etc  as  tools for the students to use   the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3  30 to 6  30   which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of some  executive mba students from houston  3 are participating   i look forward  to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker  or any other  suggestions that you might have   james s  dyer  fondren centennial chair in business  department of management science and information systems  cba 5  202  the university of texas at austin  austin  texas 78712  1175  email  j  dyer  bus  utexas  edu  telephone  512  471  5278  fax  512  471  0587,0

 alliance info alert  ferc acts to remove obstacles to address western energy crisis    omnibus order mobilizes ferc  s entire energy pricing and infrastructure  authority    to adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission  facilities    streamlines regulation of wholesale market  energy facilities siting and  licensing    promotes conservation and wholesale side of demand  response bidding    order doesn  t address price caps    meeting with western state regulators  officials set for april 6  2001 in  boise  idaho  ferc moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the  stressed california and western energy markets  ferc proposes to increase  bulk power supply in the west by removing barriers and providing incentives  that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification  licensing  and  the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate  commerce  ferc quickly wants to increase electric generation and  transmission capacity  as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale  power transactions  as well as increase the capacity of the supporting  infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines  the order  which sets new  precedent in its broadness  also proposes actions to reduce electricity  demand in the west as well as promoting the necessary wholesale  market  portion of demand  response bidding where states wish to implement the retail  side  ferc asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future  by march 30  2001   effective immediately  ferc said in a statement   the commission is  streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales   expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into california  and the west  including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly  address pending pipeline applications  and urging all licensees to review  their ferc  licensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential  for increased generating capacity    among the actions ferc takes are to  1  require the california iso and  transmission owners within all 11 states of the western systems coordinating  council  wscc  to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed  in the short term  2  waive prior notice requirements for any on  site or  self  generators that sell at wholesale within the wscc area  3  grant blanket  market  based rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric  energy that becomes available as a result of demand  response reductions in  retail and wholesale loads  and 4  broadening and extending through december  31  2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for  qualifying facilities  qfs  to increase the availability of generating  capacity   ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at  ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid  including an  increased rate of return on equity  roe  for projects that significantly  increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1  2001  or  november 1  2001  other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use  of interconnection authority under the federal power act  and to raise the  dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas  pipeline construction  on hydro issues  ferc requested comment on ways to  increase operating flexibility at ferc  licensed projects while protecting  environmental resources   in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure  ferc  asked for comments  again by march 30  on a series of economic incentives  aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection  including the  increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on  constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001   increased roe  ferc said  will also be given to system upgrades over new  transmission paths that can be in service by june 1  2002  or november 1   2002  ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10  year depreciation period for  projects that increase transmission capacity in the short  term and a 15  year  depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights  of  way that can be of  service by november 1  2002   in his dissent to the order  commissioner massey argued the order focuses on   quick fixes   and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in  demand in california  the order also  fails to address price relief   noted  massey  massey also called for a full federal power act  fpa  section 206  investigation of california issues  which would allow for the possibility of  refunds  on transmission incentive provisions  massey lamented that the  proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with  ferc policy under order no  2000  the financial provisions  he said   appeared to be  just throwing money at the problem   while generally  disappointed with the order  massey did express limited support for many  parts of the order  many of the suggestions in the order are the  same  actions as authorized last may   said massey   they were good ideas then   and they are good ideas now   he concluded   for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted   chairman hebert said the order was designed to  squeeze every additional mw  of supply available  and to encourage the conservation of mw  and stressed  that ferc is  doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems    he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in  california  but noted that generation  transmission siting  and conservation  are generally state issues   ferc  s  removing obstacles  order is posted on its web site at   citation  ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric  generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for  comments was issued on march 14  2001  docket no  elol  47  000   a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals  made follows   electric transmission infrastructure  within 30 days  the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to  prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects  that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of  rights of way   ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which  transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at  present constraints and can be in service by july 1  2001 would receive a  cost  based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a  10  year depreciable life  projects in service by november 1  2001  would get  a 200 basis point premium and 10  year depreciable life  ferc would use a  uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission  providers in wscc of 11  5   based on the roe ferc approved for southern  california edison   system upgrades that involve new rights of way  add significant transfer  capability and can be in service by november 1  2002  would get a cost  based  rate reflecting 12  5  roe  or al 00 basis point premium  and 15  year  depreciable life   facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid  which go into  service as required to accommodate the in  service date of the new plant would  get a cost  based rate that reflected a 13  5  roe  or a 200 basis point  premium  if in service by november 1  2001 and 12  5  roe if in service by  november 1  2002   for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not  involve significant capital investments  for example  installing new  technology  ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the  revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each  additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm  point  to  point rate  ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of  any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply  or  alternatively  to roll these costs into the average system rate   extension of waivers for qfs  ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency  standards for qfs  applicable throughout wscc  to allow increased  generation through december 31  2001  the waivers were to expire on april  30  2001  the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell  their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this  output to purchasing utility  the waiver for qualifying small power  production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements  under ferc regulation section 292  204  b   would be extended to december 31   2001   additional capacity from on  site generation  ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale  sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc  through december 31   2001  owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc  and used primarily for back  up or self  generation who would become subject  to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at  wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205  ferc also authorizes  such power to be sold at market  based rates  ferc waives its prior notice  requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for  interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales  quarterly reporting is  required   allows demand response bidding  ferc will allow retail customers  as permitted by state law  and wholesale  customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load  reduction at wholesale  ferc is granting blanket authorization  consistent  with its prior discussion on sales from on  site generation and requires  similar reporting   ferc  s december 15 order on the california market directed  as a longer  term  measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day  ahead market in  which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue  ferc seeks  comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this   ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail  electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for  resale in wholesale markets raises legal  commercial  technical and  regulatory issues  safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail  demand  response bidding programs  intention is not to undermine state  programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs   requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be  accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales   contract modifications for demand  response bidding  there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of  demand  response arrangements with their wholesale customers  as for mutually  agreeable qf interconnections  ferc will waive prior notice requirement for  any mutually agreeable demand  response related rate schedule amendments that  may be required to effectuate these arrangements  clarifies that  demand  response program costs should be treated consistently with all other  types of incremental and out  of  pocket costs   interconnections  fpa section 210  d  allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if  it makes a finding that such an order  1  is in the public interest  2  would  encourage overall conservation of energy or capital  optimize the efficiency  of use of facilities and resources  or improve the reliability of any  electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order  applies  and 3  meets the requirements of fpa section 212   ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section  210  d  to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load  if  the exercise of this authority may be warranted  ferc seeks comments on  whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc  region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring  immediate action   longer term regional solutions  ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless  integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and  implementing a long  term regional solution   natural gas pipeline capacity  ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas  pipeline capacity and is

 material for thu 2 mar wg meeting  fyi        forwarded by ravi thuraisingham  enron communications on 02  29  00 01  15  pm       nevil  ipn  caida  org  02  28  00 10  35 pm  to  metrics  caida  org  cc   bcc  ravi thuraisingham  enron communications   subject  material for thu 2 mar wg meeting  hello all   appended below you  ll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed  since we at caida began to get the metrics wg started  some of this  material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list  the older  material comes from personal emails  i  m posting it again to give us all  some more ideas to think about   for those who are able to attend the wg meeting in san jose this thursday   2 mar   i  d like to spend time in the morning getting to know about  attendees interests and experience in making internet measurements   i suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a  short  10 minutes  response times  and this gets even more interesting    you only need   to be able to see traffic in one direction  from client to server  to   get a fairly accurate round  trip time from the client to the server    irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement   host   because of tcps three  way handshake for connection   establishment  when you see the opening syn  you wait for the client   to ack the server  s syn ack and you have the client   server round  trip   time  i think you  ve actually already done some of this  we could   also potentially try to correlate dns queries and tcp connections    perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a   host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received   an a record  and track various application  level response times  i  d   personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response   time to tcp transfer time for http connections   even if the   measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web   transaction to the user  a full page  usually many tcp connections       anyway  i think there are some fairly interesting things we can   measure with simple techniques  these are just some simple ones    there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into   payloads of a few of the other highly  utilized applications  but doing   it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance  wise  but we now have the basic   infrastructure to do things with dns over udp  we can probably cover   any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties that   would make it completely unusable  snmp  for example    while its   application is limited  network service providers would find   round  trip time information for snmp packets from their network   management stations to agents very useful  i think there are some   rudimentary things we can do with tcp as well  and i also think some   sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information  for   example  a weighted  by traffic  round  trip time distribution for tcp   traffic to  from all networks with which you communicated  say at  24   granularity   this gives sites a notion of how close they are to   those they talk to most frequently  with a little more work  we could   probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for   which we see tcp data  we could certainly get a reasonable number for   the maximum observed bandwidth       these methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic  while we   all know the value of that  i think it  s significant in that active   probers can be run on the same host  decoupled from the actual   measurement  and with timestamps coming from kernel space  bpf   i  ve   been thinking about this for a long time  because eventually i  d like   skitter  and other tools  to be able to do use tcp packets for probing    with no need for things like ip firewall code  if i can just properly   time non  blocking connects  and count on the passive tool to see the syn   and syn ack  i can use any tcp port for round  trip time measurements and   not trick my kernel by sending tcp packets on a raw socket  i need   feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter  it needs to   know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has   been reached   but it  s not difficult  simple bytestream  oriented ipc is   sufficient       going further  i like the idea proposed by some others  maybe funded at   this point  i  m not tracking it  of instrumenting the freenix tcp  ip   stacks  a lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack    but eventually someone  s going to have to come up with what pieces of   information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack   instrumented  and it  ll have to be somewhere between what  s currently     implemented and a full  blown metering system like rtfm   and i think in   the interim  there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our   local machines  non  promiscuous and in user space  safe  easy to   implement and test   to me the benefits here are       a user is likely to have a tangible  well  understood relationship   with their workstation  understood by them   this is particularly   true for those of us with network expertise  so it  s at least   plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with   user experience in a fairly short period of time  helping us hone in   on what  s useful  even if we only find weak correlations  for   whatever reason   once a correlation exists  more people will be   interested in helping with development because it  ll be something   they  ll use personally     we  re essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions      i  d personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of   information that correlate to user experiences  so that it doesn  t   take a terabyte of disk and 64 processors to deal with data from say   10  000 desktops         anyway  just some random thoughts  the hard part for me at the moment   is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support   them     cindy bickerstaff responded     we  re just starting to capture the mss and window size negotiations between   timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual  wonder if   daniel  s code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points   caida has out there  the data could be used to fill in some parameters for   trying to model some of the passive data collected  since a typical web page   has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page   gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are   like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval    since there is a strong time of day  week effect  volumes and perf   the   short duration of the data collection from a single web page  incl    elements  might give some options for modeling  and maybe getting a better   estimate of packet loss   i  ve really enjoyed joining the e 2 e  interest group   for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts  e  g    mathis  et  al  paper    ack its bulk transfer focus    paul krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details  of how to measure common metrics like availability  reliability   throughput and latency    an example was throughput  since it was proposed   that this be measured using a tcp file transfer of   random data  one concern was what does this do   to latency  and where does this get measured  as   many customers of this service would not be large   businesses  measuring this from the customer end   of a 56  or 64  kbps circuit was almost certain to   drive end  to  end latency measurements beyond   defined bounds  measuring it from within points in   the provider  s network  s  might show figures that the   customers could never see themselves      the compromise was to define the throughput metric   as ocurring at access link loads of no more than 50    of the bit rate  but how does one measure that  and   so on        given that this discussion was recognized as being the   prelude to the imposition of minimal slas  as part of the    certification  process for service providers  this may be   an illustration of the perils of discussing slas and metrics   in some interchangable form  but they may not be easy   to separate in the minds of some   carter bullard said   i  m specifically interested in bridging   rtfm and ippm work  particularly to describe how an   rtfm can be a generic connectivity monitor  ippm   describes type  p  unidirection and bidirectional   connectivity  and a single point rtfm can detect   these conditions  but standard descriptions for how   this can be done would be very useful      personally  one of the things that i  m interested   in is tcp based streaming services performance  such   as that seen in internet radio distribution  and of   course ip telephony wireline performance metrics would   be very good to describe   nevil brownlee comments that he  s also very interested in  developing the rtfm meter as a platform for more general measurements   two areas seem interesting  apart from getting more information  from tcp streams      qos  difserv performance   what metrics do we need to characterise this     ipsec  what metrics will still be useful when we can  t  look at port numbers  what kinds of traffic can still be  identified    curtis villamizar said   i  m particularly interested in the work on dos at   http    www  cs  washington  edu  homes  savage  traceback  html and would   like to see that on the agenda   this would provide a general way of determining where packets came from   not just a tool for tracing dos attacks  ,0

 california 1  17  01 pt  ii  one of the issues we have been following with respect to the california power  crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the  issue post  inauguration  in the last two days  we have seen two signals  suggesting that the bush administration will not significantly deviate from  the  broker  role played by the clinton white house   1  in his confirmation hearing this morning  treasury secretary  designate  o  neill cautioned that  it is not clear that us intervention is needed in  california  and that the  governor must be the first line of defense    2  a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us  yesterday that  there was little that the federal government could do  specifically to help  beyond focusing on national issues  increased  production  transmission capacity etc      of course  the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with  respect to intervention than the energy team  as was true with the clinton  administration  yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from  the official bush view at this stage  further guidance should be forthcoming  with respect to this issue from energy secretary  designate spence abraham  s  testimony tomorrow ,0

the list continue to be moderated  or should it  be changed into an open list   b   working group  developments  following the caida members  meeting on 8 feb 00 i  ve attempted to define  exactly what problem we could consider getting an ietf working group  started on  my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics  is given below  appendix b   but it seems unlikely that we could get a  new ietf wg started   i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group  on  network metrics   rather than the two proposed earlier  my draft  of its charter is appended below  it focuses on producing educational  material about network measurement  and on developing new metrics  these  were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members   the wg co  chairs are  sue moon  sprintlabs  and brett watson  mfn  abovenet   you are invited to attend the first wg meeting   the agenda is as follows    agenda for caida wg meeting on  thursday 2 mar 00

charters  a  what types of network  and transport  layer metrics are being  used by isps in engineering and operating their networks   by customers for verifying service guarantees   b  what new services are being  or are likely to be  offered  e  g   diffserv  is there a need for higher  layer metrics to better  monitor and manage these services   c  will these new differentiated transport  and  application  layer services need new metrics   d  how can the service metrics be measured in a multi  isp  environment   e  how can customers verify these measurements   f  what requirements would service measurement introduce for  equipment vendors   g  how relevant are specific techniques  e  g  which flow  and  points of measurement to specific users  isp  customer  etc    requirements   h  how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived  by users  how do they correlate with performance   appendix b  background on the ietf working groups   rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement  rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two  way traffic flows   specified in terms of their end  point attributes  its primary goal was  to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the  following needs   a  wider range of measurable quantities  e  g  those  relating to ipv 6  and to class of service  b  simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c  better ways to control access to measured flow data  d  strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e  efficient hardware implementation   ippm wg  ip performance measurement  the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can  be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet  data delivery services  these metrics will be designed such that they  can be performed by network operators  end users  or independent  testing groups  it is important that the metrics not represent a value  judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad    but rather provide unbiased  quantitative measures of performance   rfcs  framework for ip performance metrics  rfc 2330   metrics   connectivity  rfc 2678    one  way delay  rfc 2679   one  way packet loss  rfc 2680

measurement   this is clearly a hard problem  e  g  does this just  mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive means  how  should the measurements be presented  etc     in short   rtfm
