835,"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

1365,"Subject: immediate reply needed  dear sir ,  i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract  award and review committee set up by the federal  government of nigeria under the new civilian  dispensation to award new contracts and review  existing ones .  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to handle a very confidential  transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge  sum of money to a foreign account .  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in  favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum  of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united  state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and  is now ready to be transferred being that the  companies  that actually executed these contracts have been  fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .  consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil  service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign  accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in  return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the  transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for  incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will  be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts  in due course .  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds  within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of  the above stated terms .  our assurance is that your role is risk free . to  accord this transaction the legality it deserves and  for mutual security of the funds the whole approval  procedures will officially and legally processed  with your name or the name of any company you may  nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .  once more i want you to understand that having put  in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my  country , i am averse to having my image and career  dented . this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .  please you should signify your intention to assist  by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this  transaction , if favorable we will take further steps  to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction .  i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100 % risk free as we have done our homework  properly .  i quite believe that you will protect our interest  by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are  still in government service , which we intend to  retire from in full honor .  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to  enable us include this transfer in the next batch  which would constitute the new quarter payments  for the 2002 financial year .  thank you and god bless .  dr james alabi",1

3281,"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .",0

4151,"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",0

i ' m  not thinking of any preparation , but more of an informal discussion of the  "" philosophical issues "" related to real options work .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jim dyer  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm  to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu '  subject : re : real options course feedback  josh ,  some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one  finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do  plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option  models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded .  i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at  a theoretical level in our last couple of readings .  the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further  discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where  volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of  volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct  risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are  almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some  modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective  probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like  to think about such ideas .  i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester  continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early ,  and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a  naive sort of way .  thanks for the feedback and comments .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am  to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu  cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com  subject : real options course feedback  after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools  presented  thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the  objective  of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety  of  problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded  financial elements .  as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off  areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that  rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust  understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions  that  result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two  issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my  superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of  projects  whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by  financial  instruments . these issues are easy to guess :  1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the  class  has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time  value  questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance  department that can present a firmer position on this question ?  2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures .  if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :  * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,  but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company ?  * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )  there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""  industries .  of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally  screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and  pemex ?

2395,"Subject: re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .  look forward to connecting with you vince .  john",0

3469,"Subject: var  david ,  during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .  mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :  we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds  of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the  problem by mapping  them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .  we have agreed on the following :  1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number  of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will  investigate the impact of a larger  number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .  2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity  should be  modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense  to monitor  the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less  transparent aggregates .  3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be  systematically  monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions .  this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the  responsibility is  dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody  is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;  cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .  vince",0

559,"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

5486,"Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees  to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order  to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for  at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south  america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to  the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the  transition , jim will join ees .  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale  businesses and the commercial support functions :  enron net works  louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and  ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .  enron americas  concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for  operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,  marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report  into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility  for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south  america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief  operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron  americas .  enron europe  the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia  and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john  sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .  enron global markets  enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and  ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have  responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the  exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to  enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the  commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,  equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .  enron industrial markets  enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,  president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .  commercial support for ews  the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,  the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in  the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more  efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across  ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these  newly defined roles are as follows :  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office  operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice  president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated  services organization with it and e -

"" we ' re there to try to discover a market  clearing price , "" said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively  due to go online in the third quarter .  enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers  of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the  storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management  application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to  available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months ,  according to thuraisingham .  under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be  connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company  currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching  centers , or "" pooling points , "" in the u . s . , and another seven overseas .  at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and  other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily  installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is "" pretty much in the  initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . ""  enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since  the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called  enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other  commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is  now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .  norman levine  enron broadband services  713 - 853 - 5010  norman _ levine @ enron . net",0

( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0

"" rather than go  through all the  hassles they [ dynegy ] had at ferc with the 1998 - 99 package , they let  someone else do  all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid . that way  no one can  complain that the procedure was tainted . after all , dynegy has quite a  few power plants  in california to keep fueled , and all of their current ft on el paso  expires at the end of  this year . of course , they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer  matches their bid . it may all sound kind of machiavellian but sort of  makes sense . "" other  sources heavily discounted the chances of dynegy being the new high  bidder , pointing out  that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  san  juan / border basis differentials narrowed significantly . a dynegy source  indicated that the  company was involved in the bidding and lost to duke in the first round .  regardless of what happens next year , a marketer noted that the southern  california  border / san juan basis spread continues to compress as socal gas  withdraws from  storage and east - of - california utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold  weather in the rockies and elsewhere in the west . from a december index  spread of 29  cents , the border / basin gap was down to about 18 cents wednesday , she  said .",0

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",0

4661,"Subject: capital book  to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge .  the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below .  the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged .  capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity .  on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost .  by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization .  questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to :  joe deffner 853 - 7117  alan quaintance 345 - 7731",0

5359,"Subject: revised : organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

3442,"Subject: p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my  understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread  option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are  assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price  process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions  extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a  ) b  ) k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap )  ) ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options  is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two  futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the  average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these  prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and  the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of  prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this  approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use  a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and  correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of  these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research",0

 i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail  the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples  from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0

that ' s why i went  into this thing !  thank ' s to the computer age and the internet !  be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !  before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing  about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national  weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated  whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the  participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are  bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .  = = print this now for your future reference = =  if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably ,  please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business !
