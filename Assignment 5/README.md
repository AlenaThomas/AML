# ASSIGNMENT 5

1. Transfer Learning for image data using CNN

- Download about 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet
  - I collected data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoreepjana/animals-detection-images-dataset. 

- In a google colab notebook, fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify duck vs chicken and output the classification report

2. Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer

- Download the sentiment analysis dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset

- Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify the sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model and print your classification report
